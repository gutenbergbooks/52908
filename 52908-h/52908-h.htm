<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>OPENING THE COTTAGE</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">“<span class="smcap">Hello</span> there!” The man with grizzled hair
and bronzed face under a shabby yachting-cap
stopped in his leisurely ramble up the street of
a seaport village, and his eyes lighted at sight
of a spare feminine figure, whose lean vigorous
arms were shaking a long narrow rug at a cottage
gate. “Ahoy there—The Clever Betsy!”
he went on.</p>

<p>The energetic woman vouchsafed a sidewise
twist of her mouth intended for a smile, but
did not cease from her labors, and a cloud of
dust met the hastened approach of the seaman.</p>

<p>“Here, there’s enough o’ that! Don’t you
know your captain?” he went on, dodging the
woolen fringe which snapped near his dark
cheek.</p>

<p>“<i>My</i> captain!” retorted the energetic one,
while the rug billowed still more wildly. She
was a woman of his own middle age, and the
cloth tied around her head did not add to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
charms; but the man’s eyes softened as they
rested on her.</p>

<p>“Here! You carry too much sail. Take a
reef!” he cried; and deftly snatching the rug,
in an instant it was trailing on the walk behind
him, while Betsy Foster stared, offended.</p>

<p>“How long ye been here, Betsy?”</p>

<p>“A couple o’ days,” replied the woman, adjusting
the cheese-cloth covering more firmly
behind her ears.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t ye let a feller know?”</p>

<p>“Thought I wouldn’t trouble trouble till
trouble troubled me.”</p>

<p>The man smiled. “The Clever Betsy,” he
said musingly. They regarded one another for
a silent moment. “Why ain’t ye ever clever to
me?”</p>

<p>She sniffed.</p>

<p>“Why don’t ye fat up some?” he asked again.</p>

<p>“If I was as lazy as you are, probably I
should,” she returned, with the sidewise grimace
appearing again, and the breeze from the
wide ocean a stone’s throw away ruffling the
sparse straight locks that escaped from her
headdress.</p>

<p>“Goin’ to marry me this time, Betsy?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Same old reason.”</p>

<p>“But I <i>tell</i> ye,” said the man, in half-humorous,
half-earnest appeal, “I’ve told ye a
dozen times I didn’t know which I liked best
then. If you’d happened to go home from
singin’-school with me that night it would ’a’
ben you.”</p>

<p>“And I say it ain’t proper respect to Annie’s
memory for you to talk that way.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t disrespectful. There never were
two such nice girls in one village before. I
nearly grew wall-eyed tryin’ to look at you
both at once. Annie and I were happy as clams
for fifteen years. She’s been gone five, and
I’ve asked ye four separate times if you’d go
down the hill o’ life with me, and there ain’t
any sense in your refusin’ and flappin’ rugs in
my face.”</p>

<p>“You know I don’t like this sort o’ foolin’,
Hiram. I wish you’d be done with it.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t ever goin’ to be done with it, Betsy,
not while you live and I live.”</p>

<p>“Have some sense,” she rejoined. “We
both made our choice when we were young and
we must abide by it—both of us.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t marry the Bruce family.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>“I did, too.”</p>

<p>Betsy Foster’s eyes, suddenly reminiscent,
did not suit in their expression the brusqueness
of her tone. She saw again her young self,
heart-sick with the disappointment of her girlish
fancy, leaving this little village for the city,
and finding a haven with the bride who became
her friend as well as mistress.</p>

<p>“I did, too,” she repeated. “It was my silver
weddin’ only last week, when Mr. Irving
had his twenty-fourth birthday.”</p>

<p>“Is Irving that old? Bless me! Then,”
hopefully, “if he’s twenty-four he don’t need
to be tied to your apron-strings. Strikes me
you’re as much of a widow as I am a widower.
There ain’t many o’ the Bruce family left for
you to be married to. After Irving’s mother
died, I can see plain enough why you were a
lot o’ help to Mr. Bruce; but when he married
again you didn’t have any call to look after
him any longer; and seein’ he died about the
same time poor Annie did, you’ve been free as
air these five years. You don’t need to pretend
you think such an awful lot o’ the widder
Bruce, ’cause I know ye don’t. Don’t ye suppose
I remember how all your feathers stood
on end when Mr. Bruce married her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Betsy gave a fleeting glance over her shoulder
toward the window of the cottage.</p>

<p>“’Twasn’t natural that I should want to
see anybody in Irving’s mother’s place, but
she’s—”</p>

<p>“I remember as if ’twas yesterday,” interrupted
Hiram, “how you said ’twas Irving she
married him for; how that she could never
keep her fingers out of any pie, and she didn’t
like the hats Mr. Bruce bought for Irving, so
she married him to choose ’em herself.”</p>

<p>Betsy’s lips twitched in a short laugh.
“Well, I guess there was somethin’ in that,”
she answered.</p>

<p>Hiram pursued what he considered his advantage.
“When Irving was on the football
team at college, you told me yourself, standin’
right by this gate, that she’d go to the game,
and when she wasn’t faintin’ because he was
knocked out, she was hollerin’ at him how to
play.”</p>

<p>Betsy bridled. “Well, what’s all this for?”
she demanded.</p>

<p>“It’s to show you plain as the nose on your
face that if you ever was married to the Bruce
family you’re a widder now; just as much as
I’m a widower.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, sir, for better or for worse,” returned
Betsy doggedly.</p>

<p>“Get out. They’re dead, Mr. and Mrs.
Bruce, both dead; and the widder Bruce nothin’
at all to you.”</p>

<p>“Stepmother to Mr. Irving,” declared
Betsy.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s used to it by this time. Had
twelve years of it. Holy mackerel, that kid
twenty-four! I can’t realize it. His mother—”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said Betsy quickly.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>she</i> anyway, Mrs. Bruce, went over
to Europe to meet him last year, didn’t she,
when she took you?”</p>

<p>“Of course she did. He went abroad when he
left college, and do you suppose she could
stand it not to be in part of his trip and tell
him what to do?”</p>

<p>“There now! It’s plain how you feel toward
<i>that</i> member o’ the family.”</p>

<p>“But I told you, didn’t I? Can’t you understand
English? I told you ‘for better or for
<i>worse</i>.’”</p>

<p>“Go ’long, Betsy, go ’long! That husky
football hero don’t need you to fight his battles.
If she presses him too hard, he’ll get married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
himself. I guess he’s got a pretty solid
place in the bank. When did you get back?”</p>

<p>“A month ago.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bruce come down here with you?”</p>

<p>Hiram’s eyes as he asked the question left his
companion’s face for the first time, and roved
toward the windows of the cottage retreating
amid its greenery.</p>

<p>As if his question had evoked the apparition,
a light-haired lady suddenly appeared in
the open doorway. She was a woman of about
forty-five years, but her blonde hair concealed
its occasional silver threads, and her figure
was girlishly slender. She regarded the couple
for a moment through her gold eye-glasses, and
then came down the steps and through the
garden-path.</p>

<p>“I thought I couldn’t be mistaken, Captain
Salter,” she said graciously, extending one
hand, ringed and sparkling, and with the other
protecting the waves of her carefully dressed
hair from the boisterous breeze.</p>

<p>The captain, continuing to trail the rug behind
him, touched his cap and allowed his
rough fingers to be taken for a moment.</p>

<p>“The Clever Betsy here was carrying too
much sail,” he explained. “I took ’em down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce laughed amiably.</p>

<p>“And found you’d run into a squall, no
doubt,” she responded, observing her handmaid’s
reddened countenance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce’s eyes could be best described as
busy. There was nothing subtle about her
glances. She made it quite evident that nothing
escaped her, and the trim exactness of
her dress and appearance seemed to match her
observations.</p>

<p>“It seems good to be back in Fairport,” she
went on. “One summer’s absence is quite
enough, though I plan to slip away just for a
little while to take a look at the Yellowstone
this year.”</p>

<p>“That so? Should think you’d had travelin’
enough for one spell,” rejoined Hiram.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s an appetite that grows with what
it feeds on, Captain Salter. I dare say you
have been a rover, too. I know how all you
sea-captains are.”</p>

<p>“No’m. My line’s ben fish, mostly.”</p>

<p>“And,” added Mrs. Bruce, “taking care of
us poor land-lubbers in summer. My son was
well satisfied with your sale of his boat. I don’t
know whether he will get another this summer
or not. You’ll be here as usual, I hope?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Looks that way.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad. I’m positively attached to the
Gentle Annie.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t got her no more,” returned
Hiram quietly. “I’ve parted with her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sorry. I suppose the new one’s
better.”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s just as good, anyway.”</p>

<p>“But if she’s not better, I don’t see why you
let the Annie go.”</p>

<p>“’Taint always in our power to hold on to
things when we’d like to,” responded Hiram
equably.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce’s eyes shone with interest behind
her bi-focals. “Poor man!” she thought.
“How improvident these ignorant people are!
Probably went into debt, and had to lose his
boat, and calculated on doing enough business
this summer to pay for the new one.”</p>

<p>“And what,” she asked, with an air of gracious
patronage, “will you call this one? Gentle
Annie second, of course.”</p>

<p>He shook his head, his sea-blue eyes fixed
intrepidly on the object of his affections, who
regarded him threateningly.</p>

<p>“Can’t be any Annie second,” he returned
quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now I think you make a great mistake,
Captain Salter,” said Mrs. Bruce, with vigor.
“For your own welfare I feel you ought to
keep that name. The summer people have
been attached to the Gentle Annie so long, and
had such confidence in her.”</p>

<p>Hiram nodded; but Mrs. Bruce could not
catch his fixed eye as she wished, to emphasize
her point.</p>

<p>“They were right,” he answered. “She was
a good craft.”</p>

<p>“Confidence in her and you too, I should
have said, of course,” went on the lady.</p>

<p>“Yes, we sort o’ went together, pretty comfortable;
but—well, I’ve lost her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but there’s a good-will goes with the
name. You make a great mistake not to keep
it. Captain Salter and the Gentle Annie; people
have said it so many years and had all their
sails and their picnics and clambakes with
you, it’s like throwing away capital for you to
take a new name for your boat. Now if you
haven’t already had it put on—”</p>

<p>“I have.”</p>

<p>Hiram’s eyes were steady, and his lady-love
was nervously fighting with the jealous wind
for her cheese-cloth headdress, her face apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
flushed by the effort, and her eyes
defiant.</p>

<p>“What have you named her?” asked Mrs.
Bruce, in disapproval.</p>

<p>“The Clever Betsy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like it, emphatically. It seems very
strange, and it will to everybody.”</p>

<p>“Yes, at first,” rejoined Hiram imperturbably,
“but you can get used to anything. It
used to be Captain Salter and the Gentle
Annie; but in future it’s goin’ to be Captain
Salter and the Clever Betsy; and after a while
that’s goin’ to seem just as natural as the
other.”</p>

<p>The speaker continued to rest his gaze on
the narrow reddened countenance, which
looked back furiously.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce attributed his averted face to
shyness, but the direction of his glance gave
her an idea.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sure, Betsy, <i>you</i> should be
pleased,” she remarked. “One might think the
boat was named for you.”</p>

<p>“Betsy wasn’t ever clever to me,” said
Hiram calmly. “She began spellin’ me down
at school here when we were children, and
she’s ben spellin’ me down ever since.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce looked curiously at the frowning
countenance of the capable woman who
had meant so much in her husband’s household.</p>

<p>“Just like a snapdragon always,” went on
Hiram slowly; “touch her and she’d fly all to
pieces; and I guess you put on the finishin’
touch, takin’ her to Europe, Mrs. Bruce. She’s
so toploftical to-day that she won’t scarcely
speak to me.”</p>

<p>“Betsy was a good traveler; I wouldn’t ask
a better,” said Mrs. Bruce absently. The subject
of the boat’s name rankled. Her desire to
coerce humanity for its own good was like a
fire always laid and ready to be kindled, and
Hiram had applied the match.</p>

<p>“What do <i>you</i> think of the new name,
Betsy? Don’t you think your old friend would
have done better to stick to the Gentle
Annie?”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I think,” was the
explosive response. “That’s the only name
that’ll ever be connected with Cap’n Salter in
this world, and he’d better make the most of
it. Hiram, if you’re perishin’ to wear a trail
I’ll make you one out o’ paper-cambric. Give
me my rug. I want to go in the house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Salter motioned toward the speaker with his
head, then met Mrs. Bruce’s eyes.</p>

<p>“You heard?” he said. “That’s what I say.
Snappy, snappy.”</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry,” said Mrs. Bruce impressively,
“that it’s painted on. It’s a bad idea
and won’t bring you luck.”</p>

<p>“Well now, we’ll see,” rejoined Hiram. “I
feel just the other way round. I think it’s a
good idea and will bring me luck. Folks’ll begin
to say Cap’n Salter and the Clever Betsy,
Cap’n Salter and the Clever Betsy, and first
news you know there’ll be—”</p>

<p>He paused. Lightnings would have shot
from Betsy Foster’s eyes had they been able
to express all she felt; but the audacity of his
look and manner conveyed a totally new idea
to Mrs. Bruce.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d both come out with me this
afternoon,” he went on. “I’ll show you just
what a good, reliable, faithful craft I’ve got.
A bit unsteady sometimes, mebbe, but that’s
only because she’s smart and sassy; she always
comes up to the mark in an emergency, and
never goes back on her skipper. She’s fast,
too, and—”</p>

<p>“Sailin’!” interrupted Betsy, unable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
endure another moment. “I guess if you saw
the inside o’ that cottage you wouldn’t talk
to me about sailin’. If you’re so fond of peacockin’
with that rug, I won’t deprive you of
it. You can leave it on the step when you get
through.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce’s idea received confirmation by
Betsy’s manner and her precipitate departure
up the garden-path, and she looked at Hiram
Salter blankly. Betsy Foster was the prop of
her household. She was the property of the
Bruce family. Did this man suppose for one
moment that just because they had gone to
school together, he could remove her from her
useful position? What a selfish, impossible
thought! Of course the man wasn’t in love
with Betsy. Nobody could be in love with such
a severely plain creature; and yet that fancy
of the new boat and the new name! It argued
a plan of wooing which had some poetry in it.</p>

<p>Here was an affair which Mrs. Bruce would
certainly stop with a high hand if there were
any real threat in it; but fortunately Betsy
would consider it as unthinkable as she herself.
If ever displeasure was writ large all over a
woman it had been evident in Betsy Foster
throughout the interview.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>After a short reflective silence during which,
both hands behind him, her companion waved
the rug in gentle ripples, and met her gaze
with an undisturbed smile, she spoke.</p>

<p>“Do take my advice still, Captain Salter,”
she said. “Wipe out the Clever Betsy and go
back to the Gentle Annie.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>MISTRESS AND MAID</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bruce</span> remained with the captain at the
gate for fifteen minutes longer before she re-entered
the house. Hiram came as far as the
door with her and laid the rug inside. He
caught a glimpse of Betsy, stormily dusting
and polishing in the living-room, but contented
himself with touching his cap to Mrs.
Bruce, and disappearing down the garden
path.</p>

<p>That lady looked sharply at her factotum
as she entered the room. Mankind loves a lover
undoubtedly, as a rule; but there are exceptions.
Mrs. Bruce decidedly did not love anybody
who proposed to deprive her of her right
hand: cook, waitress, lady’s maid, housekeeper,
either of which posts Betsy was capable
of filling in the defection of the regular
incumbent.</p>

<p>Betsy was a none-such, and Mrs. Bruce
knew it sufficiently well to have swallowed
her wrath on many previous occasions when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
her strong will had collided with that of her
handmaid. During her husband’s lifetime
Mrs. Bruce had discharged the New England
woman several times in her most magnificent
manner; but the ebullition had not been
noticed by Betsy, who pursued the even tenor
of her way as one who had more important
matters to think of. Since Mr. Bruce’s death
his widow had not proceeded to such lengths,
some intuition perhaps warning her that the
spiritual cable which held the none-such to
her service had lost its strongest strands and
would not stand a strain.</p>

<p>She looked at the faithful woman now with
a new curiosity. Mankind loves a lover. Yes,
of course; but Betsy couldn’t have a lover!
The cheese-cloth binding the hair away from
the high sallow forehead, taken in connection
with the prominent thin nose and retreating
chin, presented the class of profile which explains
the curious human semblance taken
on by a walnut when similarly coiffed. No—that
designing sailor was tired of living alone.
He wanted a housekeeper and a cook. How
did he dare! Quite a blaze of indignation
mounted in the breast of Betsy’s fortunate
owner. What a blessed thing that Betsy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the sort of woman who could see into a millstone
and could be trusted to flout her deceitful
wooer to the end. Mrs. Bruce spoke with
gracious playfulness.</p>

<p>“You never told me Captain Salter was a
beau of yours, Betsy.”</p>

<p>The other did not cease to beat up the cushions
of the wicker chairs.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I ever did take the time
to reg’larly sit down and give you my history,
Mrs. Bruce,” was the reply.</p>

<p>And that lady took a few moments to reflect
upon the spirit of the crisp words, finally deciding
to veer away from the subject.</p>

<p>“Now what can I do to help you, Betsy?
I know you want everything spick and span
before that cook comes to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Betsy looked up.</p>

<p>“I’ve laid the silver out there on the dining-room
table. You might clean it. Here, let me
put this apron on you.” And abruptly abandoning
the cushions, the speaker hurried into
the dining-room, divided from the living-room
only by an imaginary line, and seizing
an enveloping gingham apron, concealed Mrs.
Bruce’s trim China silk from head to foot.</p>

<p>The mistress sat down at the table and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
opened the silver-polish, and Betsy returned
to her work.</p>

<p>“I’ve been asking Captain Salter about the
neighbors, and especially about my little
protégée.”</p>

<p>“Which one? Oh, you mean Mrs. Pogram’s
girl!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Rosalie Vincent. With that name
and her pretty face and graceful figure, it did
seem too bad that she shouldn’t have her
chance. I remember, though, you didn’t altogether
approve of my sending her away from
washing Mrs. Pogram’s dishes.”</p>

<p>“Washin’ Mrs. Pogram’s dishes was real
safe,” returned Betsy. “Rosalie was pretty,
and poor, and young; and that’s a combination
that had better stay right in the home
village under some good woman’s wing. Mrs.
Pogram’s a clever soul, though some like
putty. If she hadn’t been, she wouldn’t have
spared Rosalie, I s’pose.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it wasn’t for long,” replied Mrs.
Bruce. “I thought it only fair that the child
should have one season’s course in English,
with such a yearning as she had after poetry
and all things poetical. Such a doom as it
seemed to be to peel Mrs. Pogram’s vegetables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and wash her dishes. I can always discern
an artist,” added Mrs. Bruce complacently,
“even in the most unlikely places; and that
girl had a touch of the divine fire. I recognized
it that day when she recited the bit of Browning
up here.”</p>

<p>Betsy’s eyes happening to fall on the silver-polish,
she remarked dryly.</p>

<p>“Well, whitin’ ’s safer than Brownin’ for
her sort, and I thought she was contented
enough.”</p>

<p>Betsy’s two-year-old disapproval of this one
of her mistress’s undertakings revived. Education
was a good thing, without doubt, but
according to Betsy’s judgment it was best,
under circumstances of such dependence as
existed with Mrs. Pogram’s pretty adopted
child, to let well enough alone. Mrs. Pogram’s
principal motive in giving the girl a home
had been the material help she could render,
and it was a doubtful experiment to send her
to the new environment of the city, and the
novel companionship of her fellow students,
unless her benefactress intended to prolong
her watch over the young girl’s fortunes; and
this Betsy knew would not be the case; for
long before Rosalie’s term of study was ended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Mrs. Bruce’s energies would be directed toward
superintending the affairs of somebody else.
The girl’s grateful letters had begun to be
ignored some time before Mrs. Bruce joined
her adored boy in Europe; and it is doubtful
when she would have thought again of
Rosalie Vincent, had she not returned to
the village where the young girl had attracted
her fleeting fancy.</p>

<p>“I gave her the wings to soar,” she now
added virtuously, “and I inquired of Captain
Salter if she had used them. I found his
report quite unsatisfactory.”</p>

<p>“Why, where is Rosalie?” asked Betsy
quickly, stopping her labors in the interest of
her query.</p>

<p>“Captain Salter wasn’t sure. He said he
supposed Mrs. Pogram knew, but there had
been some recent quarrel with a brother of
Mrs. Pogram’s and it had ended in Rosalie’s
going away.”</p>

<p>“Soarin’, perhaps,” remarked Betsy dryly,
grasping the legs of an unoffending table and
giving it vicious tweaks with the dust-cloth.
“Just as well folks shouldn’t be given wings
sometimes, in my opinion. When a bird’s got
plumage like Rosalie’s, it’d better stick to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
long grass. The world’s just full o’ folks that
if they catch sight o’ the brightness never rest
till they get a shot at it and drag it down.”</p>

<p>“Was she so pretty? Let’s see, was she
dark or light? Oh, I remember her hair was
blonde.”</p>

<p>Betsy gave one look at her employer. It
was entirely characteristic that two years
should have sunk the village girl’s memory in
a haze.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce sighed and began to polish another
fork. “It seldom pays to try to help
people,” she said. “I distinctly remember the
girl had talent, and I thought she might get
a position in one of the Portland schools if
she had a little training and applied herself.”</p>

<p>“Her letters to you certainly sounded as if
she was workin’ her best.”</p>

<p>“Did they?” vaguely. “Perhaps they did.
Well, very likely she has gone to take a position
then.”</p>

<p>“Not in summer time, I guess,” remarked
Betsy.</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to remember any brother of
Mrs. Pogram’s,” said Mrs. Bruce plaintively.</p>

<p>“Humph! You’ve probably bought ribbons
of him lots o’ times. He sells ’em up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Portland, and I’ll bet it’s a strain on him
every time he measures off over thirty-five
and a half inches for a yard. Brown’s his
name. Loomis Brown; and it would seem
more fittin’ if ’twas Lucy. Such a hen-betty
I never saw in all my days. I wonder if it’s
possible he took to shinin’ up to Rosalie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s a bachelor?”</p>

<p>“Law, yes. He wouldn’t want to pay for
a marriage license, but p’raps he took such a
shine to Rosalie as she grew older that it
spurred him on to the extravagance. No
tellin’. If that’s the case, no wonder she took
wings.”</p>

<p>“It’s very tiresome,” said Mrs. Bruce, “the
way girls will marry after one has done one’s
best for them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Bruce. The next time you take
a fancy to a village girl, you give her a course
in cookin’ instead of English. She can jaw
her husband all right without any teachin’;
but it takes trainin’ to make good bread.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce sighed leniently. “That is your
point of view, naturally,” she said. “You
could hardly be expected to have that divining
rod which recognizes the artistic. Strange
how much better I remember that girl’s gift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and her unstudied gestures than I do her
face.”</p>

<p>Betsy paused long enough in her undertakings
to pull up the bib of her mistress’s apron,
which had slipped, endangering the pretty
silk gown. There was a permanent line in
Betsy’s forehead, which might have been
named “Mrs. Bruce the second”; but she
fastened the apron as carefully now as she
did all things pertaining to that lady’s welfare,
and made no reply to the reflection upon her
æsthetic capabilities. Betsy would not have
known the meaning of the word æsthetic, but
she would have declared unhesitatingly that
if it characterized Mrs. Bruce she was willing
not to have it describe herself. Not that she
had a dislike of her mistress. She took her
as she found her. Mr. Bruce had been attached
to her, and Betsy’s duty was to the
bearer of his name. She seldom contended
with her mistress, nor had any argument. She
said to herself simply that it was hard to teach
an old dog new tricks; and while it might seem
a trifle rough to mention an old dog in connection
with a lady of Mrs. Bruce’s attractive
appearance, the sense of the axiom was
extremely applicable, since Mrs. Bruce could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
become no more set in all essentials if she
lived to be a hundred.</p>

<p>Betsy very rightly realizing that avoidable
discord was foolishness, lived her philosophy,
and contented herself with mental reservations
which would have astonished her complacent
mistress mightily.</p>

<p>On the evening, twelve years ago, when
Mr. Bruce announced to his housekeeper his
impending marriage, she shouldered this cross
resolutely.</p>

<p>He had been a man of few words, and on
this occasion he said simply to the woman who
had seen his happiness with the bride of his
youth, “I find myself very lonely, Betsy. I
am going to marry Miss Flushing.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir,” she replied quietly, though
her heart leaped to her throat and her thoughts
flew to the twelve-year-old boy who was then
at home on his vacation. “Have you told Mr.
Irving, sir?”</p>

<p>She remembered the father’s face as he
replied, “Yes. That boy, Betsy, is a manly
little chap. Miss Flushing is devoted to him
and has gained his affection already; but—it
was a blow to him. I saw it. A surprise, a
great surprise.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Betsy remembered to this day how she bit
her tongue to keep it from speaking.</p>

<p>“He talked to me though,” the father had
continued, “more like one man to another
than like a child; but after being very civil
about it, he announced that I mustn’t expect
him to call her mother, because he should not
be able to.”</p>

<p>Betsy had nodded. “Mr. Irving had a
mother out of the ordinary, Mr. Bruce,” she
replied very quietly, but with the hot blood
pressing in her head; then she went up decorously
to her room, closed the door, and indulged
in one storm of weeping; after which
she shouldered the cross above mentioned,
which like all crosses heartily borne, lightened
as the years went on.</p>

<p>One thing was certain. Greater devotion
was never displayed by a stepmother; and if
Irving Bruce had mental reservations, too, he
did not divulge them to the faithful woman
who was part of his earliest remembrance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>IRVING BRUCE</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bruce</span> had retired from her labors, but
a vigorous cleansing process was still going on
in the cottage, when a man’s footsteps again
sounded on the garden-path. Some one set
a suit-case down on the porch, and then appeared
in the doorway for a moment of inspection.</p>

<p>Betsy started at sight of the tall, gray-clad
apparition.</p>

<p>“Mr. Irving!” she ejaculated, and the
transfiguring expression which crossed her
face gave the key at once to her loyalty. “Go
’way from here, we ain’t a bit ready for you!”
she said severely.</p>

<p>He strode forward and gently shook the
speaker’s angular shoulders instead of her
busy hands.</p>

<p>“Great that I could get here so soon,” he
returned, continuing to rest his hands on her
shoulders, while she looked up into the eyes
set generously apart under level brows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“He ain’t any job lot,” she thought for the
hundredth time, “he’s a masterpiece.” But
all the time she was trying to frown.</p>

<p>“We ain’t ready for you,” she repeated.
“The cook hasn’t come.”</p>

<p>“Bully!” ejaculated the unwelcome one.
“It’s the aim of my existence to catch you
where there isn’t any cook. Are the mackerel
running?”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to ask Cap’n Salter or some
other lazy coot about that. Mackerel running!
Humph! My own running has been all
I could attend to the last two days. Mrs.
Pogram’s supposed to look after the cottage—air
it and so on; but she always was slower’n
molasses and I s’pose she don’t get any younger
nor spryer as the years go on. I’ve found
mildew, yes, I have, <i>mildew</i>, in a number o’
places.”</p>

<p>The young man smiled, dropped his hands,
and sauntered to a window overlooking the
tumbling blue.</p>

<p>“She has what’s-her-name there, that girl
she adopted,” he responded carelessly. “Why
doesn’t she shift such duties upon her?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you remember Rosalie, do you?”
asked Betsy dryly, as she resumed her work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“To be sure. That was her name. Pretty
name. Pretty girl. A real village beauty.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Betsy. “You very likely remember
Mrs. Bruce took a lot of interest in
her. Had her here to speak poetry one day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I remember her very well,” returned
the young man. “I don’t recall the poetry
though. So that was her forte. Apt to interfere
with opening up and airing out other
people’s cottages, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, if it’s encouraged. Hers was encouraged.”</p>

<p>Betsy’s lips snapped together and her tone
caused her companion to glance around at her
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Mildew sort of got on your nerves, Betsy?”
he asked, amused. “Don’t worry. There’s a
free-for-all chemistry here that will fix it up
in no time. Drop that duster and come and
look at the ocean. It will steady you.”</p>

<p>“Steady me!” Betsy gave a derisive grunt.
“Tell that to the marines. I’ve had experience
of its steadiness the last month, haven’t
I?”</p>

<p>Irving laughed at certain memories of his
companion’s walnut profile, with lips pursed
in the throes of endurance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“You aren’t a star sailor, are you?” he
returned.</p>

<p>“I learned the meanin’ o’ one phrase o’
Scripture; learned it for life. ‘Unstable as
water.’ It fits some folks just splendid and
you couldn’t say anything worse about ’em.
My! will I ever forget tryin’ to wait on Mrs.
Bruce and fix my hair in that stateroom!
Never got my arms up that there didn’t come
a lurch and knock my elbow against the woodwork
fit to break the skin.”</p>

<p>“You ought to be better upholstered,
Betsy,” said Irving.</p>

<p>“And varnish!” she continued, with reminiscent
loathing. “Shall I ever be able to use
varnish again!”</p>

<p>“Joy!” exclaimed Irving. “Then I’m not
in any danger of being shellacked! I never
felt certain in childhood’s happy hour that
keeping me surgically clean would wholly satisfy
you.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Betsy warmly, “the ocean
won’t get me to look at it this summer. All
diamonds, and blue sparkles, and white
feathers, just as if butter wouldn’t melt in
its mouth; then when it gets you in its clutches,
bangs you around from pillar to post and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
nearly blows the hair off your head. I know
its tricks now. It’ll never deceive <i>me</i> again.”</p>

<p>Irving smiled out at the maligned billows.
“Looks pretty good to me,” he returned.
“Wonder what I shall do about a boat. Has
Mrs. Bruce said any more about the Yellowstone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, spoke of it this mornin’ to Cap’n
Salter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, has she been out with Hiram already?”</p>

<p>“No, he was lally-gaggin’ around here for a
while.”</p>

<p>“How is old Hiram?” The question was
affectionate.</p>

<p>Betsy pushed an upturned rug under a
table-leg.</p>

<p>“Oh, about as usual, I guess. Gets more like
himself every year, same as we all do.”</p>

<p>“Well, he couldn’t do better. He’s a good
sort.” Irving smiled at some memory. “I
must have made that man’s life a burden.
What a lot of patience he had! But when the
end was reached, I can feel that hand of his
come down on me, big as a ham, and toss me
away as if I’d been a cunner he was throwing
back. Mrs. Salter, too. Talk about salt of the
earth! I suppose that must have been a stock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Fairport pun during her life. Many a time
she begged me off. The gentle Annie! I
should think so. Let’s see. How long has she
been gone?”</p>

<p>“Five years.”</p>

<p>“And the captain has never taken notice
since, has he?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask <i>me</i>,” was the curt response; and
a table was whisked completely around with a
celerity which must have given it vertigo.</p>

<p>“Betsy! Betsy!” It was a cautious call
which came quietly from the invisible.</p>

<p>Betsy straightened herself and moved toward
it, and the silent moment was followed
by the swift entrance of Mrs. Bruce.</p>

<p>“My <i>dear</i> boy!” she exclaimed, aggrieved.
“I thought I heard a man’s voice. How long
have you been here? Betsy, why didn’t you
tell me!”</p>

<p>The young man’s eyes were kind as he turned
and came to meet the speaker, and his manner
seemed very quiet in contrast to her alert, fussy
personality and the froufrou of her taffetas.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Madama,” he said, returning
her nervous embrace lightly. “I’ve asked
Betsy so many questions since I broke in here,
that she couldn’t in civility leave me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Betsy returned to her labors, deaf to her
mistress’s remarks. She knew that Mrs. Bruce
had a chronic objection to her having a tête-à-tête,
however short, with Irving. It was as
if the widow were jealous of the twelve years’
advantage which her maid had over her; and
notwithstanding Betsy’s humble position, her
mistress constantly imagined that they referred,
when together, to events which she had
not shared, and spoke on subjects which
would be dropped upon her appearance.</p>

<p>The newcomer slipped her hand through
the young man’s arm, and moved with him
as he returned to the window.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you telegraph? How did you
happen to come so soon?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I just saw that the bank was run by
a lot of egoists who supposed that they could
manage it without me, just as they have for
thirty years, so I thought I would make the
most of this last summer of their self-satisfaction,
and take all that was coming to me,
before I get into the harness.”</p>

<p>“Very wise; and I hope when you do get
into harness you’ll never make such a slave
of yourself as your dear father did.”</p>

<p>“You never can tell. I rather dread my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
own proclivities. If I should ever work as hard
as I’ve played, the business world is going
to be jarred when I leap into it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce hung fondly on his arm, rejoicing
in the hard muscle she felt through his
light sleeve.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “I’m glad you could
come. There is such a wonderful feeling of
freedom in this restful spot. Sometimes,”
pensively, “I think the greatest blessing we
have in life is personal freedom. I suffocate
without it, and it is astonishing how difficult
it is to get, in the ordinary affairs of life.”
Then, with sudden attention, “What makes
you wear that tie with that suit? I don’t like
it at all, anyway. That isn’t one that I gave
you.”</p>

<p>The young man’s hand mechanically sought
his throat. “No, Madama,” he admitted,
still looking absently from the window.</p>

<p>“I should think, Irving, as many neckties
as I pick out for you, you might wear one of
them when you’re going to be with me.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t bear to wear your neckties,”
he returned gently, “they’re so decorative in
my room. To tie them all up and bury them
under a collar and vest would be a shame. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
hang them on my tie-rack, where they can be
admired morning, noon, and night. You know
I keep trying to curb your extravagance in
that line. You’ll impoverish yourself so that
you can’t wear silk stockings if you go on like
this. Every few days a new tie to go on the
rack.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” returned Mrs. Bruce curtly.
“If I didn’t have such good taste, of course I
shouldn’t venture to buy ties for a man; but
even as a girl I was considered to have the
most perfect taste. I was famous for it, and I’m
sure, Irving, I’ve tried to instill it into you.”</p>

<p>“You have, Madama,” he returned soothingly,
“and I think I’m a credit to you. Now
come, I’m prepared to maintain that I’ve
caught the infection, and that my taste is
perfect, too.” He stifled a yawn. “To prove
it, I’ll throw down the bone of contention,
collar and all, and get into a sweater. I’m
going to hunt up Hiram before lunch and swap
lies for a spell.”</p>

<p>So speaking the young man stepped out on
the porch, picked up his suit-case, and walked
through the spreading cottage until he came
to his room, where Betsy was whisking things
into readiness for his occupancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“There! Do you smell?” she asked, sniffing
disapprovingly; “just like a cellar?”</p>

<p>“No,” he returned plaintively, “I don’t
think I do.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say do <i>you</i>; I say, don’t <i>it</i>,”
snapped Betsy, in no mood for badinage. “If
you hadn’t come so soon, I’d have had it
aired out. I’d like to shake Mrs. Pogram till
her teeth chatter.”</p>

<p>Irving set down his suit-case.</p>

<p>“As I remember, Mrs. Pogram’s teeth aren’t
calculated to chatter. They don’t—what
is the technical term now?”</p>

<p>Betsy grunted. “I do feel ashamed to have
you come into such a comfortless place, Mr.
Irving.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather be here, Betsy, even if I have
to wear a clothes-pin on my nose while unmaking
my toilet. I can sleep on the porch,
you know. You think—eh, Betsy, you think
there’s no use trying to side-step the Yellowstone?”</p>

<p>“We’re as good as there,” returned Betsy
sententiously. “Mrs. Bruce says that when
once you get into that bank, she might as
well count on the wind that blows as you
taking a vacation at any stated time; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
you know it’s got to be a stated time for the
Yellowstone.”</p>

<p>Irving sighed.</p>

<p>“I hope we know our place, Betsy,” he returned.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>MRS. POGRAM CONFIDES</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Half</span> an hour afterward Mrs. Pogram, unconscious
of Miss Foster’s yearning to administer
to her portly person a vigorous movement
cure, walked leisurely up the village street.
From one hand depended a long slender package
which she held away from her black shawl
by a string loop around her forefinger.</p>

<p>A merry whistling attracted her, and she
perceived coming along the walk, at a swinging
gait, a bareheaded young man in a
sweater. In a few days the streets of the village
would be largely populated by girls and
men, all with an aversion to hats and sleeves.
Mrs. Pogram was familiar with the type, and
noted that this care-free person was an advance
guard proving that the summer was here.</p>

<p>She eyed him, however, with lack-lustre eyes
until he stopped suddenly before her.</p>

<p>“You don’t know me,” he said, taking his
hands out of his pockets.</p>

<p>The corners of Mrs. Pogram’s lips drew
down and her chin drew in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, Irvin’ Bruce, it’s you!” she declared.
“We haven’t seen you in these parts for so long
I didn’t know but you’d given up Fairport.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t do that, Mrs. Pogram. You
know how a man always returns to the scene
of his crimes.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pogram again drew down the corners
of her mouth and gave her gingerly-held package
a shake.</p>

<p>“This pesky fish never will be done drippin’,”
she remarked.</p>

<p>“Been fishing?” asked her companion.</p>

<p>“Yes. I go fishin’ on the wharf. It’s
cheaper than to the market and the walk
does me good.”</p>

<p>“You look well.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t well. It’s kind o’ hard for me to
get around, and I miss Rosalie. She’s gone
off.” Mrs. Pogram’s voice took a whining note,
and she indulged in a sniff of self-pity. “I
donno as you ever saw Rosalie?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I’ve seen her.”</p>

<p>“The way I come to take her, I was gettin’
along in years and she was left alone in the
world. She wanted a home and I wanted
young hands and feet, so we’d ’a’ got along real
comfortable if it hadn’t been for Loomis; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
I’ve been more like a mother than a sister to
Loomis, bein’ so much older, and I do think
he might have let me have a little comfort
without naggin’ me all the time.”</p>

<p>“Has he left Portland and come here to live
with you?”</p>

<p>“Oh no, he’s still in Chatham’s store, but
he can run down over Sunday any time, you
know, and ever since Rosalie came he’s done
so a great deal.”</p>

<p>“What could you expect?” returned Irving.
“I remember her.”</p>

<p>“Hey? Oh, yes, Loomis was awful pleased
with her at first, but she didn’t seem to take
much of a fancy to him. Kinder laughed at
him. Loomis <i>is</i> sort o’ fussy. Anyway, she
made him mad one day, and from that on he
didn’t give me any peace.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pogram sniffed again and gave her
lachrymose package another shake so that its
tears bedewed the walk as if she were weeping
vicariously.</p>

<p>“He made you send the girl away?” asked
Irving quickly, a line coming in his forehead
at the remembrance of the mincing young
clerk who had been the natural victim of
many a prank of his own boyhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not <i>made</i> me, exactly,” returned Mrs.
Pogram, “but Rosalie got so she wouldn’t
stand it any longer. You see,” her complaining
tone altering to one of some complacence,
“though I ain’t any millionairess, my estate
ain’t exactly to be sneezed at. The old Pogram
mahogany and the silver that was my mother’s
are worth considerable; and Loomis was on
pins for fear I’d give some of ’em to Rosalie.
I give her a spoon once—it was real thin,
Irvin’, not worth much of anything in money,
but it was a time when Rosalie’d taken care
of me through a fever and I felt to give her
somethin’; and law, from the way Loomis
took on you’d ’a’ thought I’d made him a poor
man for the rest of his life. Honestly I was
ashamed of him; and I kep’ his actions away
from Rosalie as much as I could; but she’s
smart, and she saw she’d gained Loomis’s
enmity by laughin’ at him, and saw that he
was gettin’ kinder jealous of her about the
things; and if she would only have been quiet,
and spoken him fair, and we both kept our
own counsel, I could have slipped many a
little thing to her and he’d never ’a’ known the
difference. Things weren’t ever the same
after your mother gave her that winter at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Lambeth. She never laughed at Loomis till
after that, and then came my sickness and I
gave her the spoon, and from that time there
wa’n’t ever any peace.”</p>

<p>The line in Irving’s forehead came again.
“Then you don’t think Mrs. Bruce’s gift to
Rosalie was an advantage.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was willin’ to spare her for her
own good, for I could see what her longings
were, and felt I hadn’t ought to stand in her
way. Loomis favored it because I think ’twas
his idea then that he and Rosalie would both
come into the Brown-Pogram estate one o’
these days.”</p>

<p>Irving lifted a hand to conceal some ebullition
which escaped him at the thought of the
ramshackle ancestral halls of the Pograms.</p>

<p>“As I say,” continued Mrs. Pogram, “if
Rosalie could have worked with me we’d ha’
kep’ Loomis smoothed down; but after the
spoon trouble that young one acted like all
possessed. Every time Loomis came she’d
throw out remarks to scare him. ‘Oh, Auntie
Pogram,’ she’d say, ‘just look how exactly
the right height this work-table is for me to
set by. It’s the real stuff this wood is;’ and
then she’d gaze at it kinder thoughtful. ‘If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
this was polished up, that grain would come
out beautiful.’ Then there is a silver slop-bowl
and creamer that was my mother’s.
‘Oh, Auntie Pogram,’ she’d say, and just
clasp her hands and gaze at ’em like they was
magnets and she a needle. ‘How easy it is,
after all, to tell the real antiquities from the
made-up ones,’ she’d say. ‘How I do love
that colonial pattern!’ And all the time
Loomis would fidget and run his fingers through
his hair and get red in the face. After
he’d go I’d talk to her, but she wouldn’t do
a thing but laugh till the tears come in her
eyes.” Mrs. Pogram nodded significantly.
“But the day came when there was more tears
and not so much laugh. Loomis got so he
come down every Saturday night. He made
a list of all the silver and he’d count ’em out,
forks and spoons, every time he came. One
Sunday night he said something real downright
mean to Rosalie about beggars not bein’
choosers. I spoke up for the girl then and
there. I said Rosalie had earned everything
she’d had from me and earned it fully. I can
see her now standin’ there, and the way her
nostrils opened when she breathed. I don’t
think I ever saw her as good-lookin’ as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
was that minute. Her light hair was just
fluffin’ out like a cloud, and her blue eyes
turned nearly black, and her lips was bit in
between her teeth till she scared me the way
she looked at Loomis. Then she went out o’
the room without a word. The next mornin’
she didn’t get up at half-past four to get
Loomis’s breakfast, the way she had to when
he stayed Sunday nights. I hadn’t thought
she would, and I got up in my double-gown
and found him drinkin’ some cold milk, and
growlin’. Loomis likes his coffee. I told him
’twas his own fault, and he told me to go to
bed and stay there,—’twas all I was fit for.”
Mrs. Pogram sniffed again and shook the fish
mechanically.</p>

<p>“I didn’t hear any sound in Rosalie’s room
when Loomis slammed the front door; so after
a spell I went in to find her and try to make
peace, but—” the speaker shook her head—“there
wa’n’t any Rosalie. Her bed was made
up neat and there was a note on her table.
‘I love you, dear Auntie Pogram, but I can’t
stand it any longer. Don’t worry about me.
If I’m in any trouble I promise to write to
you.’”</p>

<p>Here, the fish not seeming equal to the occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Mrs. Pogram dabbed some tears from
her own eyes.</p>

<p>“How long ago was this?” asked Irving.</p>

<p>“Only a few weeks, and I haven’t heard
another word.”</p>

<p>“Your brother is satisfied, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Well, he ain’t real comfortable, ’cause he
knows I don’t mean to live and work all
alone. I ain’t fit to; and he’s afraid now
I’ll pay wages that’ll be a tax on the estate.”</p>

<p>Irving muttered something under his breath.</p>

<p>“Hey?” inquired his companion plaintively.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for all this, Mrs. Pogram. You
must tell Betsy about it. Her head is full of
sensible ideas. Perhaps she can help you.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see her,” returned the other
mournfully. “How are you all?”</p>

<p>“All well.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been to Europe. Now I s’pose
you’ll settle down a spell.”</p>

<p>“Alas, Mrs. Bruce decrees otherwise. We’re
off for the Yellowstone as soon as we can unpack
and pack again.”</p>

<p>“I hear it’s real sightly out there,” returned
Mrs. Pogram, without enthusiasm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
“I’ll have to tell Betsy to get some one else
to look after the cottage, though; I ain’t fit
to hist mattresses.” Another sniff. “Good-mornin’,
Irvin’, I’m real glad I met you. Remember
me to the folks.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>ROSALIE VINCENT</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">A throng</span> of pilgrims to the Yellowstone was
emptying out of the cars upon the platform
at Gardiner. The spectacular six-horse coaches
were in waiting, and the customary competition
and struggle for the outside seats began.
Mrs. Bruce was wild-eyed in her determination
to sit near the driver, and Irving turned
to Betsy, who spoke promptly:—</p>

<p>“Never mind me, Mr. Irving. Just go up
top with Mrs. Bruce. I’ll go inside.”</p>

<p>Which plan was accordingly carried out;
and Mrs. Bruce was ensconced to her satisfaction
where she could ask questions alternately
of the driver and her son.</p>

<p>The jingling, gay teams started, and wound
up the ascending road under a vast sky above
the encircling hills and mountains. As they
passed the Eagle’s Nest Mrs. Bruce had her
first qualm as to Betsy. Upon being told that
the high-placed bundle of sticks perched on
a cliff was indeed the domicile of the king of
birds, she exclaimed:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Irving, couldn’t you stoop over and
call down to Betsy to put her head out? That
is such a purely American sight, and Betsy is
so American!”</p>

<p>But Irving, objecting to this contortion,
diverted his companion’s attention.</p>

<p>As for Betsy, she preferred the seclusion
from the sight of the six horses so dexterously
tooled along the road, and felt that she saw
all the scenery she cared for despite the roof
of the stage. Miss Foster must have had an
excellent conscience; she always accepted with
such contentment her own society.</p>

<p>There was a chatter of voices in her ears
from the other occupants of the stage, but her
eyes rested absently on hillside and waterfall
while she thought of Fairport and the deserted
cottage whose condition was still far
from satisfying her. Her thoughts roved, too,
as they often did, to Rosalie Vincent. What
was the girl doing, out in the world unprotected?</p>

<p>It seemed but a short time to Betsy before
the coach swung around the circle in front of
the Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel, and the
passengers poured from the vehicle, watched
by other crowds on the hotel piazza, who half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
resented the arrival of newcomers, for at this
season food and beds were at a premium.</p>

<p>Irving had looked out for the comfort of
his party, and Mrs. Bruce’s room satisfied her.
They spent the day in the customary visits
to beautiful terraces of heavenly tints built
by boiling-hot scanty waterfalls, and at night
laid them down to slumber well contented.</p>

<p>In a remote room of the hotel a young girl,
after her evening’s experience of standing
upon her feet long hours, waiting upon hungry
hordes of sightseers, was hastening to get
ready for her night’s rest, when the handle
of her door was turned, and then as if some
one outside was impatient of its resistance,
it was shaken with energy.</p>

<p>The half-disrobed occupant of the room ran
to hold the door.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” she demanded.</p>

<p>A sharp girlish voice replied imperatively,
“It’s me! Open the door quick!”</p>

<p>“You’ve made a mistake in the room,”
returned the girl inside. “This is mine.”</p>

<p>“Is it, indeed!” shrilly. “Well, I guess if
you don’t open this door pretty quick, I’ll
have you sent flying!”</p>

<p>At which threat in the sharp voice, the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
inside opened the door and viewed in astonishment
the stormy-eyed young person who
entered, beginning to pull out hairpins from
her lofty pompadour as she came. “What did
you think you were? A lay-over?” she demanded
scornfully.</p>

<p>The other girl, her fair hair falling in ripples
about her bare neck and arms, closed the door
and regarded the newcomer with wide eyes.</p>

<p>“Is it your room, too?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” snapped the other, “and I hope
it won’t be any more disagreeable for you
than it is for me.”</p>

<p>“Oh—oh—of course not,” returned the
fair one. “I only thought it was so small—and
the bed is so narrow—and I didn’t know—”</p>

<p>“Well,” returned the other, somewhat mollified,
and with a yawn, “I saw down in the
dining-room to-night that you were a green-horn.
We’re mighty lucky not to be in a
bigger room with half-a-dozen girls. My name’s
Miss Hickey. What’s yours?”</p>

<p>“Rosalie Vincent,” responded the fair one,
still standing rooted to her place while Miss
Hickey removed a mammoth rat from her
hair, and eclipsed with it one side of the wash-stand,
which was dresser as well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Better get to bed, Miss Vincent. You’ll
have plenty of chances to stare at me, and you
look as tired as I feel. I stayed down to help
the pearl-divers awhile to-night.”</p>

<p>“Pearl-divers?” echoed Rosalie.</p>

<p>“Yes. Dish-washers, Greenie. I’m a heaver
like yourself; but we all have to turn in and
help each other, once in a while. This is my
third season. My first I waited on the sagebrushers.”</p>

<p>“Who are they?” asked Rosalie, overawed
by so much sophistication.</p>

<p>“Campers; but I like the hotels best. The
dudes are more my style.”</p>

<p>“What did you call me a few minutes ago?
A lay-over?” asked Rosalie.</p>

<p>“Yes, those are the swells that stay more
than one night. They’re the princes of the
Yellowstone and they have to pay like princes,
too. All their dishes washed separately, separate
food, separate everything. I thought you
must think you were one to have a room all
to yourself.”</p>

<p>Miss Hickey here completed her hasty
night-toilet and jumped into bed. “Come
along, child. I’ll make myself small against
the wall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Indeed, I’m not a lay-over,” said Rosalie,
now hastening to follow the other’s example.
“I’m to be sent on with the crowd to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” returned the other, with nasal
sleepiness; “and I’m darned sorry, too. I like
the swatties here better than at any post.”</p>

<p>“Swatties?” echoed Rosalie helplessly.</p>

<p>“Soldiers, Greenie,” drawled Miss Hickey.
“You’ll see a lot more of ’em before you see
less. Now I ain’t goin’ to say another word
to-night.”</p>

<p>And Miss Hickey kept her word. Her sleep
was as energetic as her waking; and Rosalie
listened to her heavy breathing and stared
wide-eyed into the darkness.</p>

<p>She had recognized the Bruce party at the
evening meal. She had not been obliged to
wait on them, and knew herself unobserved.
But the discovery had excited her very much.
Mrs. Bruce had been right when she said that
Rosalie’s was the artistic temperament. The
independence, caution, and reserve of the New
Englander were not her characteristics. She
longed for companionship and some one with
whom to sympathize in the present predicament;
for predicament she felt it to be. How
extraordinary that this should be the summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
chosen by the Bruces for their visit to the National
Park.</p>

<p>She thought of the irreverent punctuation
which made a well-known quotation read:
“There is a divinity which shapes our ends
rough, hew them as we may.”</p>

<p>She had believed Mrs. Bruce to be in Europe,
and though that lady’s natural preoccupation
there explained the ignoring of her
protégée’s painstaking letters, it did not
excuse it, or leave Rosalie the slightest hope
that her benefactress continued to feel an
interest in her. The fact was a hurt to the
grateful girl, and the ever-present consciousness
of it gave her a reason for desiring to
leave Fairport, where the Bruces would return.
This sensitiveness would not have induced her
to leave Mrs. Pogram, had the latter’s brother
not made her stay unendurable, but it was a
secret reason for being glad to escape.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mrs. Bruce and her son would not
remember her at all; but she could not expect
to escape Betsy Foster’s recognition. So she
lay there awake; at one moment longing for
Mrs. Pogram’s kindly, invertebrate protection,
and wishing that Mrs. Bruce had never
opened to her another world; and again feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the fire of ambition to repay that lady
every cent she had ever spent upon her.
Rosalie’s color pressed high as she imagined
Mrs. Bruce’s amazed scorn that the talents in
which she had at least for a time believed, had
carried their possessor no higher as yet than
to be a waitress—a heaver, according to Miss
Hickey—in the Yellowstone.</p>

<p>The girl must at last have dozed; for she
shortly experienced a vigorous shaking from
her companion.</p>

<p>“Here, here, hustle!” exclaimed Miss Hickey,
not unkindly. Rosalie opened her eyes with such
bewilderment that her companion laughed.</p>

<p>“Come on, blue eyes. You look like a baby.
Get into your duds. We’re off for Norris
Basin, worse luck.”</p>

<p>The sight of Miss Hickey’s readjusted pompadour
gave Rosalie a realizing sense of the
situation.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Hickey,” she exclaimed, as she
hurried to the washstand, “are many people
lay-overs?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve got them on the brain, have
you?” asked the other, proceeding with her
own toilet. “Not many, ’cause it costs too
much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“I saw some people here last night who have
lots of money—oh, lots and lots! Shouldn’t
you think they’d stay?”</p>

<p>“H’m. I only <i>hope</i> they will,” rejoined Miss
Hickey, “as long as we’re going. The crowds
are fierce.”</p>

<p>“I do hope they will!” Rosalie’s echo was
fervent. She almost summoned courage to
tell her aggressive companion the situation;
but one glance at the young woman’s coiffure,
which was now receiving the addition of a
bunch of curls, arrested her.</p>

<p>Miss Hickey regarded her companion sharply.</p>

<p>“You ain’t a heaver all the year,” she remarked
tentatively, “or else you wouldn’t be
afraid o’ those rich folks. There’s the tips, you
know.”</p>

<p>Rosalie was silent.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you was their waitress and ran off
to see the world without giving notice.”</p>

<p>“No, I wasn’t that; but I—I know them,
and—”</p>

<p>The speech drifted into silence.</p>

<p>“You know rich folks, do you? Lucky you.”</p>

<p>“Not exactly. They—she—” stammered
Rosalie, “they helped—educate me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re educated, are you?” retorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Miss Hickey, giving her coiffure a satisfied lift.
“Well, so am I. I’m a typewriter in Chicago,
winters.”</p>

<p>“Does—does it pay well?” asked Rosalie,
with such serious wistfulness that Miss Hickey
forgave her her rich acquaintances.</p>

<p>She grimaced. “Not so you’d notice it. I
ain’t goin’ back this fall. You know the Yellowstone
Company’ll land you just as many miles
from the Park as they brought you, and in any
direction you say. Me for Los Angeles. I ain’t
afraid I can’t make my living, and I’m sick o’
bein’ snowed on, winters, without any furs.”</p>

<p>Rosalie looked enviously at the other’s snapping
black eyes.</p>

<p>“Wonder what savage we’ll go over with,”
pursued Miss Hickey, stuffing her nightgown
into a bag, and nonchalantly running her comb
and toothbrush into her stocking.</p>

<p>“Over? Over?”</p>

<p>“Yes, over to Norris in the stage.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that <i>savages</i> drive them?”
asked Rosalie, her eyes dilating.</p>

<p>Miss Hickey laughed. “Oh, you’re more
fun than a barrel o’ monkeys,” she observed.
“The drivers certainly are savages. You can
ask anybody in the Park.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Rosalie smiled faintly as she began twisting
up her hair. “Oh, that’s some more Park English,
is it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I hope it’ll be Jasper,” said Miss Hickey,
“but we won’t get to sit by him, anyway. The
dudes all fight for the driver’s seat. I’m going
down now. Hurry up, Baby, or you’ll catch it.”</p>

<p>Rosalie obeyed in a panic, and was soon
ready to follow. She dreaded the ordeal of the
breakfast-room, and prayed that she might be
delivered from the Bruces’ table. Her heart
came up in her throat when she saw them
enter the door; but she was not obliged to
wait upon them. As it happened, Miss Hickey
had that station, and Rosalie devoted herself
assiduously to a deaf gentleman who was traveling
with his wife and a young woman at
sight of whom Rosalie colored. “Oh, how
small this big world is!” she thought; “but
she won’t remember me. We seldom met!”</p>

<p>The ordeal of breakfast was at last over,
and Rosalie with relief yielded herself to Miss
Hickey’s orders, and presently the girls stood
on the great piazza of the hotel, but on the edge
of the crowd, watching the systematic filling
of the stages which were starting on the tour
around the Park.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“How shall we know when to go?” she
asked of Miss Hickey, to whose side she clung
in the confusion.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about that,” returned the
other. “Have some gum?”</p>

<p>She offered several sticks of the same to
Rosalie, who declined, wishing her veil were
thicker as she glanced about, dreading to see
the Bruce party, and longing to be safely away.</p>

<p>Miss Hickey slid a generous quantity of
gum into her own mouth and then settled her
hat more firmly on her pompadour by a rearrangement
of largely gemmed hat-pins.</p>

<p>While she proceeded in an experienced manner
to break up and chew the gum-sticks into
a solacing sphere, her conversation continued,
untrammeled by this effort.</p>

<p>“Don’t you hear the agent calling the names
off?” she asked. “They can’t any of ’em say
where they’ll go any more’n we can. They’re
going to be took ’round the Park just like a
kid out in its baby-wagon. They come when
they’re called, you bet; and they don’t know
where their bags are any more’n you do.
When they get to the Fountain House their
bags’ll meet ’em in the hotel; then to-morrow
mornin’ they’ll disappear again to meet ’em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
at the next place. Oh, it’s a great system all
right, if too many people didn’t come at
once. They have awful times when there
ain’t enough places for ’em to sleep, and six or
seven get put in one room. These folks that
are too exclusive to travel with a party are the
ones that get left; for the conductors of these
tours get to the hotels a little ahead o’ the
other folks, and get all their people provided
for; and it’s gallin’ to know you pay just as
much as anybody and yet have to herd in with
folks you never saw before—just the same
as poor heavers like us.” And Miss Hickey
gave her companion a nudge that nearly made
her reel. “Weren’t you the mad kid last
night?” she continued.</p>

<p>“I think you were the mad one,” rejoined
Rosalie. “I was dazed.—O Miss Hickey!”
She made the exclamation involuntarily; for
the Bruce party came out of a door not far
from where the girls were standing, and they
were dressed for a move.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re not lay-overs!” exclaimed Rosalie,
retreating behind Miss Hickey’s broad
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Who—them? Say, what’s the matter with
you? Have you stole their diamonds?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you think they’re going in this next
stage?” asked Rosalie nervously. “Do watch,
Miss Hickey. You’re so tall you can see everything.”
For the Bruces had moved to the other
side of the piazza and were lost in the crowd.</p>

<p>“I waited on those folks at breakfast,” said
Miss Hickey, craning her neck and chewing
with such open vigor that she momentarily
recalled a dog who endeavors to rid his back
teeth of a caramel.</p>

<p>“I know you did,” replied Rosalie; “I saw.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t he grand!” exclaimed Miss Hickey.
“I thought when I was pourin’ his coffee that
he was just about the size I’d like to go through
the Park with on a weddin’ trip. The way he
said, ‘No sugar, please!’ Oh, it was just grand.
It made me forget every swattie at the post.
There ain’t an officer here that can stand up
to him, I don’t think.”</p>

<p>“Do see if they are getting into that stage!”
asked Rosalie, still in retreat behind her companion’s
ample shoulder.</p>

<p>“Nit,” responded Mr. Bruce’s admirer sententiously.
“That swell woman with him went
down the steps to get in, but his nibs there
that’s loadin’ ’em told her to chase herself.”</p>

<p>The crowd was dispersing with celerity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“There ain’t but two stages left,” went on
Miss Hickey, with excitement. “If they don’t
go in that next one, we’re all booked to go
together. Say, wouldn’t that be grand?”</p>

<p>“No! No! No!” exclaimed Rosalie, emerging
from her barrier and watching with dilated
eyes.</p>

<p>The stage swept up to the steps. The tourists
swarmed into it like bees. Again Mrs.
Bruce essayed to enter, and Rosalie could see
Irving draw her back, while Betsy Foster stood
impassive at a little distance, observing the
scene with inexpressive eyes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE LAST STAGE</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">“<span class="smcap">I should</span> like to know why they put us in
the last stage!” demanded Mrs. Bruce, in an
irate tone.</p>

<p>“Many advantages,” returned Irving, with
a twinkle of his eyes toward Betsy.</p>

<p>“There are not, Irving Bruce, and you ought
to have done something about it! Haven’t we
always heard about the dust of the Yellowstone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s why they oil the roads now,”
returned Bruce pacifically, “and we don’t have
to hurry, by this means, you see. Take our
own time. Don’t have to hurry past anything
to make room for the next stage.”</p>

<p>“I never could endure <i>leavings</i>!” exclaimed
Mrs. Bruce, her eyes still snapping as the last
stage came around the curve toward the steps.</p>

<p>Betsy attracted her attention.</p>

<p>“See those folks you said looked so aristocratic,”
she said quietly. “They’re goin’ with
us.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce followed the direction of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
maid’s meaning glance and observed the deaf
gentleman’s party of three. Insensibly Mrs.
Bruce’s ireful expression relaxed. There was
that in the tone of this party which could
lend distinction even to the last stage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce gazed at the trio appreciatively.</p>

<p>“I marvel,” she murmured to Betsy, “that
they haven’t their own equipage.”</p>

<p>Betsy sighed with relief and felt that the day
was won.</p>

<p>Having observed the dignified, florid-faced
man with the white mustache, the tall woman
in half-mourning, and the quiet young
girl who accompanied them, Mrs. Bruce spoke
again distinctly:—</p>

<p>“If I should not be taking any one’s place
on the driver’s seat, I should like to sit there
very much.”</p>

<p>“We shall take turns as to that, I fancy,”
replied Irving. He noticed the small rubber
device hanging about the neck of the deaf
gentleman and turned to the lady beside him.</p>

<p>“Will you sit up in front to start off?” he
asked, lifting his hat. “Your husband enjoys
more through the eyes than through the ears,
I observe.”</p>

<p>The lady, with whom smiles were evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
a rarity, met his eyes and essayed one. She
thanked him, and turning to her companion
pointed to the driver’s place, as they moved
down the steps.</p>

<p>The gentleman shook his head and motioned
the lady into the middle seat of the stage, which
she entered.</p>

<p>“But where is Robert?” she exclaimed in
a sort of dignified panic. “Miss Maynard,”
turning to the companion who waited passively,
“I thought you said you saw my son a moment
ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Nixon, in the office,” replied the
girl.</p>

<p>“Henry! <i>Henry!</i>” pursued the lady, pushing
against the deaf gentleman’s shoulder both
to attract his attention and to prevent his
entering the stage. “Robert!” She mouthed
the name distinctly and motioned toward the
hotel. “<i>Robert!</i>”</p>

<p>“Damn Robert!” returned the other, under
the usual impression of the deaf that his heartfelt
expression was inaudible.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact no one observed it in
the confusion. Mrs. Bruce was absorbed in
mounting to the coveted place with the driver.
Irving offered to put Betsy up beside her; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Miss Foster declined. “Get right up there,
Mr. Irving. I’m going in here behind you.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two waitresses had obeyed
a summons, and Rosalie with her head down
and praying to be invisible hastened with her
companion to the steps. Her prayer was answered,
because all the party were too preoccupied
to note the two girls who came
swiftly by and entered the back seat of the
stage. Moreover, at the same moment out
from the door of the hotel came a young fellow
in outing clothes and cap, who was greeted
with well-bred rebuke by Mrs. Nixon, and a
grunt of relief from the deaf gentleman, who
put Miss Maynard into the seat and followed
her.</p>

<p>“Well, I told you not to bring me, didn’t
I?” responded Robert. His voice was loud
and cheery, and had, in his more gleeful moments,
a trick of breaking into a high register
with a joyous inflection which endeared him
to those who enjoyed his conversation. He
was clean, gay, and young; but if he possessed
any beauty it was of the mind; and among his
acquaintance there was a wide difference of
opinion on this point.</p>

<p>While his mother voiced her dignified rebuke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
his quick eye glanced along the stage
to take in its possibilities.</p>

<p>Rosalie was shrunk into the further corner
of her seat, directly behind the Nixon party,
and Miss Hickey, meeting his glance, chewed
vigorously while lifting her head with an
elegant air of impersonality.</p>

<p>In Robert’s own mental vernacular he
“passed up the gum.”</p>

<p>The driver’s seat was full, the alternative
was the one in front of his mother’s party,
where Betsy Foster reigned alone. He stepped
in beside her while he spoke to his mother.</p>

<p>“I told you not to bring me,” he declared
again, cheerfully. “I told you I’d be more
trouble than I was worth.”</p>

<p>“You actually detained the stage, dear. I
was about to send your uncle Henry to find
you.”</p>

<p>Quick as a flash the culprit snatched the
device which aided the deaf gentleman’s hearing,
and shrieked across it above the clatter
of the stage.</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever do it, Uncle Henry. Rise
up and declare your rights. What if I am
lost?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I say,” responded the older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
man, equably. “Small loss. One of my rights
is not to have my ear-drums cracked. They’re
sufficiently nicked already.”</p>

<p>He took back the rubber disk with decision.</p>

<p>Irving had turned around during this interchange
and looked down from his high perch.</p>

<p>“Hello, Nixie,” he said.</p>

<p>Robert leaned forward with alacrity, and
took the down-stretched hand.</p>

<p>“<i>Et tu, Brute?</i>” he cried, his voice breaking
joyously.</p>

<p>Betsy stole the first glance at her companion.
His unfeigned gladness to see her idol was in
his favor.</p>

<p>He turned to his mother: “Bruce of our
class. Didn’t you recognize him? Best fullback
the college ever saw.”</p>

<p>“I did think there was something familiar
about that young man’s face,” responded Mrs.
Nixon. “Most attractive; and such charming
manners.” Her carefully modulated voice fell
agreeably on Miss Foster’s ears. “He tried to
give us the front seat; but the lady with him,”
Mrs. Nixon raised her eyebrows, “was so very
anxious to secure it, that I was glad your uncle
refused.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce turned and looked down to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Irving’s friend, and exclaimed at once, beaming
with interest:—</p>

<p>“I remember you perfectly, Mr. Nixon.
You were so funny on Class Day.” As Mrs.
Bruce spoke, her eyes roved again to the
young man’s party.</p>

<p>“I remember you at the games too, Mrs.
Bruce,” replied the young fellow, rising, “and
for the same reason. You were so funny!
We’re a couple of family parties, it seems.
My mother, and my uncle, Mr. Derwent, are
here, and at the first stop we’ll all become
acquainted.”</p>

<p>So saying, Robert dropped back into his
seat, and turning with scarce a pause to his
mother, said explanatorily, “Brute’s stepmother.
An up-and-coming dame. You will
have to meet her.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon frowned at him significantly
and nodded her head toward Betsy’s immovable
back.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Robert airily, and glanced
at the woman who shared his place. The walnut
profile impressed itself upon him for the
first time, and in connection with the Bruces
he now remembered the woman to whom
Irving had been so attentive on various college<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
occasions. “I’ll be jiggered,” thought the
youth, “if it isn’t Brute’s nurse! Well, we
are being chaperoned through the park, good
and plenty.”</p>

<p>Then he amazed his mother by addressing
his companion.</p>

<p>“Why, how d’ ye do? Why didn’t you speak
to me?”</p>

<p>Betsy gave her odd one-sided smile as she
looked back at his cheerfully grinning countenance.</p>

<p>“It’s all so long ago now, Mr. Nixon, I
didn’t suppose you’d remember me. I didn’t
know you at first.”</p>

<p>“I’m not at all surprised. I’ve grown old
and decrepit in the last two years; but to show
you my mind isn’t failing yet, I can tell you
where I last saw you. It was in a gondola in
Venice.”</p>

<p>Betsy smiled and nodded.</p>

<p>“I remember your calling across to Mr.
Irving very well, Mr. Nixon.”</p>

<p>“Good. Your memory’s all right, too.”</p>

<p>Helen Maynard, sitting quiet and forgotten
at Mrs. Nixon’s elbow, looked at Robert with
some approval for the first time. He swung
around in his seat so suddenly that he accidentally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
caught her glance. Miss Maynard
had a symmetrical little nose and mouth, and
he liked the way she did her hair; and wearing
her present expression it occurred to him for
the first time that the young woman, who was
both his uncle’s stenographer and his mother’s
companion, was rather fetching.</p>

<p>“Did you see the formation pretty thoroughly
yesterday, Miss Maynard?” he asked
briskly.</p>

<p>Her quickly averted eyes sought the splendid
sweeps of Jupiter Terrace which the stage
was now passing.</p>

<p>“Quite thoroughly,” she replied briefly.</p>

<p>“We went the regular round,” said Mrs.
Nixon. “Your uncle was really bewitched
with everything.”</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent, his hands crossed upon the
head of the stick he carried, sat in the isolation
of the deaf; his eyes fastened upon the delicate
and wonderful coloring of the stationary cascades
of deposit, over which the water was
trickling; building—ever building greater
beauty with its puny persistence.</p>

<p>He caught his nephew’s eye with a good-humored
twinkle. “Great example of what
industry will do,” he remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Fierce!” replied Robert, and made an
energetic dive for the rubber disk, which his
uncle foiled by a quick move. The youth
fixed Mr. Derwent with his gaze, and moved
his lips with care to be distinct.</p>

<p>“I’ve always refused,” he declared loudly,
“to have the busy bee or the coral insect
thrown at me; and I now add the Yellowstone
water to the black list.”</p>

<p>“If words,” replied Mr. Derwent, “could
build anything, you would rear temples of
amazing height, Robert.”</p>

<p>“And rare beauty,” added the youth. “Don’t
forget that, please.”</p>

<p>Miss Hickey changed her gum to the other
side of her mouth. “Ain’t he fresh?” she murmured
to her companion. “Did you see the
look I gave him when he come up to the stage?
I tell you I wasn’t goin’ to have him crowdin’
in here with us.”</p>

<p>“I waited on them at breakfast,” murmured
Rosalie. “He’s just jolly all the time.”</p>

<p>Miss Hickey bridled. “Well, he wouldn’t
jolly me more’n once. I know his kind: awful
fresh;” and the gum gave a vault and turn
which only the most experienced can accomplish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“And they’re all friends!” murmured Rosalie
apprehensively.</p>

<p>“Oh, brace up!” returned Miss Hickey impatiently.
“If you haven’t stolen their spoons
I don’t see what you’re so scared of; and you’re
too much of a baby to have done that.”</p>

<p>“No, I never—never lived out anywhere,”
breathed Rosalie.</p>

<p>“Well, if you think it’s such a disgrace to
be a waitress in the Park, what did you come
for?”</p>

<p>As Miss Hickey scented offense, her tone
began to rise, and Rosalie grasped her arm
pacifically. “No, no, it isn’t that! It isn’t
in the least that!”</p>

<p>The girl’s conscience squirmed a little as she
made this reply, and she swallowed and went
on. “It’s a long story, too long to tell, and not
interesting; but oh, Miss Hickey, do try to
wait on the Bruces this noon, won’t you, like
a dear good girl!”</p>

<p>“’Twon’t be up to me; but I’d be mighty
glad to do it, you bet! Did you hear that fresh
chap call him Bruty? <i>Bruty!</i> That prince!
Well, I’ve got a name for <i>him</i> all right. Did
you ever study about them heathen gods?
I did. I’ve got an awful good education if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
do say it; and there was one of ’em so ugly
if he walked by a clock it would stop. His
name was—let’s see; it was Calabash. Well,
it just fits that feller to a T. If I looked like
that, I’d go way back and sit down instead of
fillin’ the stage so’t nobody can look at anybody
but him.”</p>

<p>“The girl with them seems to be a companion,”
whispered Rosalie. “I tried to get
that sort of a place.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shoot!” returned Miss Hickey, trying
the endurance of the gum severely. “I could
get that job easy, I know, on account of my
education and knowin’ my way round the way
I do; but there ain’t enough freedom to it.
If we’d rather go to a Swattie ball now than
to sleep, we have our choice; but a companion
has got to be right on the job night and day.”</p>

<p>Rosalie looked off at the distant mountains,
and then back at the nape of Miss Maynard’s
pretty neck, and began to wonder if she was
as lonely as herself. Apparently Mrs. Nixon
addressed no one except her son, and Rosalie
guessed that Miss Maynard, placed behind
her employer’s cold shoulder, was in reality
as far removed from her as she herself felt
with regard to her neighbor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The beautiful, beautiful world! Rosalie
sighed and leaned forward, the better to get
the splendid sweep of vale and mountain, and
suddenly caught the eyes of Robert Nixon,
his arm thrown along the back of the seat as
he turned to converse with his mother. Rosalie
shrank back into her corner. Betsy Foster
might turn around, too!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>THE NATIONAL PARK</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Perched</span> on the driver’s seat, with Irving
beside her, Mrs. Bruce was as near the zenith
of contentment as falls to the lot of mortal.</p>

<p>The driver himself, philosopher as he was,
discovered in the first three miles that it would
not be necessary for him to volunteer any information,
as everything he knew would be
extracted from him, down to the last dregs of
supposition.</p>

<p>“Three thousand feet of ascent in a mile,
Irving! Think of it!” exclaimed Mrs. Bruce,
as they neared the Hoodoo Rocks.</p>

<p>“I’d rather think of an ascent of one thousand
feet in three miles,” returned Irving.
“It’s less strain on the brain.”</p>

<p>The driver gave him an appreciative glance
across Mrs. Bruce’s smart traveling hat.</p>

<p>“Oh, is that it?” she rejoined. “Perhaps
I did get it a little twisted.”</p>

<p>Here they came in full view of the desert
of gaunt, pallid trees, amid the gigantic
Hoodoo Rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, what a dreadful scene!” exclaimed
Mrs. Bruce. “Such a dreary stretch of death
and desolation! Driver, why do they allow
such a thing in the Park?”</p>

<p>A hunted expression came into the driver’s
eyes. He had been gradually growing more
and more mechanical in his replies. Now he
maintained a stony silence.</p>

<p>“If I were here at night, alone,” continued
Mrs. Bruce, “I should go straight out of my
mind! I’m so temperamental I could not—I
really could <i>not</i> bear it;” and she shuddered.</p>

<p>“Then I positively forbid your coming here
alone at night,” declared Irving. “We must
preserve your mind, Madama, at all costs.”</p>

<p>“But it’s a blot on the Park. It’s more suggestive
than the worst Doré picture. Boo!”
Mrs. Bruce shuddered again, and looked fearfully
at the dead forest, sparse and wild, rearing
its barkless trunks amid the giant rocks
of wild and threatening form. “The government
ought to do something about it.”</p>

<p>“You flatter Uncle Sam,” said Irving. “I
don’t think any one else expects him to move
mountains.”</p>

<p>“Well, they might train vines over it,”
suggested Mrs. Bruce; and the driver burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
into some sound which ended in a fit of coughing,
while Irving laughed.</p>

<p>The sudden beauty of the scenery diverted
Mrs. Bruce from her plans for reform. Her
enthusiasm over the view led her to turn and
look down to catch Betsy’s eye.</p>

<p>“Are you seeing?” she cried.</p>

<p>Betsy nodded several times to express appreciation.</p>

<p>“It’s just like life, isn’t it?” went on Mrs.
Bruce pensively to her son. “Full of startling
contrasts. Do you know, Irving, I think Mr.
Nixon is talking to Betsy?”</p>

<p>“No doubt he remembers her,” returned
Irving. “He has seen her as often as he has
you.”</p>

<p>“That’s true; but it’s nice of him, just the
same.”</p>

<p>Irving smiled. “Nixie’s got to talk,” he
remarked.</p>

<p>“But you know,” said Mrs. Bruce, “there
<i>are</i> snobs in the world.”</p>

<p>“So I’ve heard.”</p>

<p>“I like Mr. Nixon, anyway,” she went on
argumentatively. “It isn’t necessary for a
man to be handsome.”</p>

<p>Irving sighed. “What a blessed relief that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
you think so, Madama! Otherwise I’m sure
you’d call upon the Creator, and make it a
subject of prayer.”</p>

<p>“Irving, you’re making fun of me.”</p>

<p>“You know, Madama, that I never did
such a thing.”</p>

<p>The stage drew to a standstill. Rosalie
Vincent’s eyes were starry as she looked in
worshipful silence, and she momentarily forgot
her situation.</p>

<p>Miss Hickey gazed and chewed.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to have me a new apron,” she said.
“A chump in the kitchen burned one o’ mine
yesterday.”</p>

<p>The stage moved on and paused again in
the picturesque pass that leads to the Golden
Gate, while all eyes rested upon the Rustic
Waterfall, whose tuneful grace as it leaps from
ledge to ledge down the worn rock, speaks of
life and beauty, striking after the desolation
just passed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce’s suspended accusation was
repeated as the horses started. “You do make
fun of me, Irving,” she said.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he returned. “I simply recognize
your spirit of knight-errantry. Glorious
business.” He smiled at her. “Journeying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
through the world and righting wrongs as
you go.”</p>

<p>“I really do think the vines would be a
lovely idea,” she declared; and the driver
coughed again.</p>

<p>“See how the Hoodoos prepared you to
revel in the present beauty,” said Irving.
“You just said that it wasn’t necessary for
all men to be handsome. Same thing applies
to landscape, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“But his mother is very handsome, I
think,” replied Mrs. Bruce, her butterfly
habit of mind coming in play; “and that
gentleman,—did he say—”</p>

<p>“Are you talking about Nixie? Oh yes, his
mother is <i>grande dame</i>, and I’ve heard him
speak of that uncle, Mr. Derwent, often. He’s
the capitalist of the family, I believe.”</p>

<p>“The girl,” went on Mrs. Bruce, “seems to
be a companion. I noticed Mrs. Nixon didn’t
say much to her.”</p>

<p>“Is that the sign of companionship?” asked
Irving. “Something for you to fix, Madama.”</p>

<p>“She’s a very ladylike looking girl,” replied
Mrs. Bruce.</p>

<p>“Nixie’ll talk to her all right if she has ears,”
remarked Irving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s very nice of him to be nice to Betsy.
Who else is in the stage?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice.”</p>

<p>“Driver,” Mrs. Bruce turned to her bureau
of information, “did you notice who is on
the back seat of our stage?”</p>

<p>The driver’s imperturbable lips parted.
“They put two heavers in there, I believe,”
he replied.</p>

<p>“<i>Who?</i>” Mrs. Bruce spoke in italics.</p>

<p>“Waitresses from the hotel. They move
them sometimes with the crowd.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce kept silence a moment to recover
the shock. The presence of the Nixon party
still proved the respectability of the last stage,
however.</p>

<p>“Heavers! Is that your slang out here?”
she asked at last, and laughed. “I hope that
isn’t descriptive of the way we’re going to be
waited on, Irving.”</p>

<p>Rosalie’s heart fluttered again on leaving the
stage at Norris Basin; but the celerity with
which the experienced Miss Hickey hurried her
into the hotel to take up their duties aided her
wish to be unnoticed. The verandas were alive
with passengers already arrived, all ravenous
from hours of coaching in the mountain air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>At last Rosalie, in her white gown and apron,
stood in her appointed place, and the crowds
began to be let into the dining-room. Miss
Hickey was at some distance from Rosalie,
and the latter felt a little hysterical rise in her
throat in the knowledge that the snapping
black eyes were watching for Irving Bruce.</p>

<p>The Nixon party came before the Bruces,
and Mr. Derwent spied Rosalie and hastened
his dignified footsteps toward her table.</p>

<p>“The waitress we had this morning,” he
said to Mrs. Nixon. “She has a head on her.”</p>

<p>“Sounds alluringly like champagne,” murmured
Robert to Miss Maynard, who ignored
him.</p>

<p>Rosalie involuntarily gave a shy smile as
Mr. Derwent nodded at her. She could have
embraced them all in her gladness to be delivered
from waiting on the Bruces, who now
entered, and, tragical to relate, fell short of
Miss Hickey’s table. That damsel, however,
being at once overwhelmed with orders from
a famished group, had no time to mourn.</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent looked with pleasant eyes at
Rosalie when he ordered his soup.</p>

<p>“You enjoyed the drive over,” he said.
“There are roses in your cheeks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Consommé?” returned Rosalie
faintly, the blush roses referred to deepening
to Jacqueminot.</p>

<p>Robert glanced up and saw that this was
the fair girl who had kept so still behind her
veil on the back seat all the morning.</p>

<p>“I take my hat off to Uncle Henry,” he
said, again addressing Helen Maynard, who
was seated beside him. “He can see more out
of the back of his head than I can with my
eyes.”</p>

<p>“I will order for us both,” said Mrs. Nixon
to Rosalie; and forthwith proceeded to do so
with an air which forbade levity.</p>

<p>When Rosalie had received her orders and
hastened from the room, Robert again unburdened
himself.</p>

<p>“If I could get at that rubber ear of Uncle
Henry’s,” he remarked to his demure neighbor,
“I’d tell him he was a sad dog. A very good
thing he brought me on this trip.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Derwent’s eyes mean more to him
than ours do to us, naturally,” returned Helen.</p>

<p>“And I tell you,” returned Robert devoutly,
“anybody endears himself to Uncle Henry
who brings his coffee just right. That blonde
must have done it this morning. How,” turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to his mother, “does my mother enjoy
democratic traveling? This girl is a peach;
but you should see the other one that was
with her this morning in the coach. Did
you?”</p>

<p>“No,” returned Mrs. Nixon coldly. “Why
should I trouble myself about my neighbors?
I came to see the scenery.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Robert shrugged his shoulders,
“all is, you’ve missed a chance to see how a
perfect lady should behave. Her gum-manners
were a dream; but cheer up! You’ll have
a chance this afternoon, doubtless.”</p>

<p>Here Rosalie brought the soup. Helen
Maynard looked up at her and received a
strange impression of familiarity.</p>

<p>“She looks like some one,” she said softly.
“Who is it?”</p>

<p>“I know,” responded Robert promptly,
“Hebe.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t met her yet,” returned Helen.
“I’m climbing the mount of Olympus by slow
and easy stages.”</p>

<p>“Now if you mean anything about <i>me</i>,”
returned Robert briskly, “speak right out.
I can’t cope with clever people. If you’re
clever, I’m done for.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh!” ejaculated Helen softly. “Lambeth!”</p>

<p>“Is that any relative to shibboleth?” effervesced
Robert. “Because I can say it. See?
Better let me in.”</p>

<p>“Lambeth is a school,” returned Helen,
and stole another look at their busy waitress;
“a school where I went.”</p>

<p>Irving Bruce had Betsy on his right hand,
but Mrs. Bruce absorbed him; and Betsy sat
looking before her, idly waiting for her meal.
Her roving glance fell suddenly on Rosalie’s
blond head as the girl was leaving the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Why, that looked like Rosalie Vincent,”
she reflected; then thought no more of it until
later, when, her eyes again roving to that table,
she obtained a full view of the fair-haired
waitress as the girl refilled Mr. Derwent’s
glass.</p>

<p>Betsy held her knife and fork poised, while
her steady-going heart contracted for a second.
“That is Rosalie Vincent!” She held
the exclamation well inside, and looked at
her neighbors. They had evidently noticed
nothing, and Betsy devoutly hoped they
would not. It was doubtful whether Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Bruce would recognize her protégée in any
case; but instinctively Betsy desired to prevent
her from doing so; and contrary to her
habit of speaking only when she was spoken
to, she began commenting on the scenery; and
Mrs. Bruce was impressed with the unusual
docility and willingness to be enlightened
displayed by her stiff-necked maid, whose
thoughts were busy during the whole of her
mistress’s patronizing information.</p>

<p>“And some time, Betsy,” finished Mrs.
Bruce, “I will show you some pictures by a
great artist named Doré, illustrating the
Inferno, and you will be reminded of the
Hoodoo Rocks.”</p>

<p>Betsy listened and replied so respectfully
that her mistress remarked on it afterwards
to Irving.</p>

<p>“All this travel is developing that hard,
narrow New England mind of Betsy’s,” she
said. “You can see it.”</p>

<p>And all the time Miss Foster was in a mild
Inferno of her own, for her heart had always
warmed to Rosalie Vincent, who used frequently
to make her the confidante of her
small hopes and fears, and whose sunny, confiding
nature had endeared her to Betsy, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
often aroused an unspoken sympathy in the
sordid conditions of the girl’s lot.</p>

<p>Betsy’s one ambition now was to get the
Bruces out of the dining-room before Mrs.
Bruce should discover where the wings she
had bestowed upon Rosalie had fluttered.</p>

<p>“I won’t try to see the child,” thought
Betsy, “but I’ll write to her as soon as we
get away from here.” She cast a furtive glance
at the young girl. “She looks like one o’ these
pretty actresses,” she thought, “rigged up to
wait on table on the stage.”</p>

<p>She saw that Rosalie was keeping an eye
on the Bruce party, and nervous in the fear
of recognition; and this added to her relief
when, Mrs. Bruce’s appetite satisfied, she
begged Irving to hurry so that they might
view the smoking wonders without.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE BLONDE HEAVER</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">“<span class="smcap">Isn’t</span> it remarkable,” asked Mrs. Bruce,
“that we were just talking about the Inferno?”</p>

<p>She, with her companions, had come down
from the hotel into the hissing, steaming tract
of the Norris Basin.</p>

<p>Deep rumblings were in their ears. Narrow
plank-walks formed a footing amid innumerable
tiny boiling springs, while the threatening
roar of larger ebullitions and the heavy sulphurous
odors of the air gave every indication
that here indeed was the gateway to that
region where our forefathers believed that the
unlucky majority paid the uttermost farthing.</p>

<p>The Nixons had also elected to walk through
the Basin, meeting the stage at a point farther
on.</p>

<p>“Say, Brute,” called Robert, “doesn’t this
beat New Year’s for the time, the place, and
the good resolution?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon’s nostrils dilated in disgust at
the evil smells.</p>

<p>Irving caught a glimpse of her expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mrs. Nixon is making up her mind never
again to do anything wrong,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“I always said my Hades would be noise,”
she replied, “but I begin to think it will be
odors.”</p>

<p>“I always said <i>mine</i> would be dirt,” declared
Mrs. Bruce, “but I believe I’d prefer
that to being boiled. Irving, don’t you let go
of me. This is the wickedest place I ever saw.
Those little sizzling springs are just hissing to
catch my feet.”</p>

<p>The party stopped to watch the heavy
plop-plop of a mud geyser.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Robert, “while we’re all
thinking on our sins and properly humble, is
the time to get acquainted. Mrs. Bruce, this
is my mother, and my uncle Mr. Derwent,
and Miss Maynard; and Mr. Bruce you all
know by reputation.”</p>

<p>Betsy had moved to a remote corner of the
geyser.</p>

<p>“I never know just how to address that
member of your party,” said Robert to Irving.</p>

<p>The latter smiled. “She would tell you she
was just Betsy. She’s such a good soul that
down East, in the village where she comes
from, they call her Clever Betsy; and she’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
all that New England means by the adjective,
and all that Old England means, too.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Rosalie Vincent was making her
hasty preparations for another move, and to
her came Miss Hickey in a state of high satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I’m staying, Baby,” she cried, her eyes
snapping. “I guess there must be a lot of
lay-overs. Anyway they need me, and there’s
a Swattie ball to-night. Hurray!” Miss
Hickey executed a triumphant two-step and
knocked over a chair.</p>

<p>Rosalie seized her arm. “Can’t I stay too,
then?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, you can’t, Blue-eyes. You’re to go.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you go and let me stay!” begged
Rosalie nervously.</p>

<p>“And lose the ball?” exclaimed Miss
Hickey. “Well, believe <i>me</i>, you’ve got nerve!”</p>

<p>Rosalie looked as if she were going to cry,
and Miss Hickey’s good-nature prompted a
bit of comfort.</p>

<p>“Besides, if you’re afraid of the lock-up,
this is your chance to side-step those folks.
More’n as like as not they’re among the lay-overs.”</p>

<p>At this consideration Rosalie did brighten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and when the last stage came around, Miss
Hickey was present to speed the parting
heaver whose apprehensive glance about her
saw no familiar figure.</p>

<p>“Oh, they <i>are</i> staying, Miss Hickey!” she
exclaimed, in hushed tones.</p>

<p>The sophisticated Miss Hickey did not respond,
but nodded affably to the driver.</p>

<p>Rosalie breathed a relieved farewell as she
left the big-boned bulwark of her friend and
obeyed the agent’s signal to enter the back
seat of the stage. The vehicle was empty but
for a stout man with a field glass strapped
across his shoulders who mounted to the seat
beside the driver, and they started.</p>

<p>The whole stage to herself! Rosalie could
scarcely believe it.</p>

<p>She listened to the strange noises in the air
and watched the steam which, mounting high,
would make one believe that the locality was
alive with factories. The girl’s curious gaze
roamed about, and she thought wistfully of
such travelers as might visit at their leisure
the wonders about her.</p>

<p>There were great beauties, however, even
for a heaver to enjoy. The morning’s ride had
been a keen pleasure in the intervals of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
embarrassment. The profusion of wild flowers;
monk’s-hood, hare-bells, and Indian paintbrush,
had fed her eyes with their splashes
of color; and the behavior of the wild animals
made one think of the millennium. Sure of
protection from being hunted and slain, the
chipmunks sat up on their hind legs close to
the road, to watch the stage go by, clasping
their tiny hands beneath their chins, like
children in ecstasy at seeing a pretty show.
Frequently one would be seen sitting up and
nibbling the seeds from a long stem of grass,
which he held in such a manner that he appeared
to be playing a flute. A big marmot
here and there lay along a bough or rock,
turning his head lazily to view the tourists
through his Eden. Boiling springs and boiling
rivers, hill, vale, mountain, and waterfall—all
these had Rosalie enjoyed, even with
the fear that the Bruces would turn around;
and now! Think of making one stage of the
picturesque journey with no companion but
her own thoughts! It seemed too good to be
true; and she soon found that indeed it was so.</p>

<p>The driver drew his horses to a walk, and
Rosalie perceived that many of the other
stages were in sight, some of them stopping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and that tourists were entering them from the
roadside.</p>

<p>Soon it became the turn of the last stage,
and Rosalie’s heart bounded to recognize all
the companions of the morning.</p>

<p>She saw Mrs. Bruce gaze sharply at the
stout man in her seat by the driver.</p>

<p>“Won’t your mother go up there, Nixie?”
asked Irving.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon refusing, her son put Miss
Maynard up, the young woman climbing to
the place with alacrity.</p>

<p>Rosalie turned her head to gaze fixedly at
the other side of the road. She grew warm as
she felt some one climb into the seat beside
her, but did not turn her head back, even when
the coach started.</p>

<p>Finding herself not addressed, presently
she turned about and looked squarely into
the eyes of Betsy Foster.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Rosalie?” said the latter
composedly.</p>

<p>“O Betsy!” exclaimed the girl softly, and
seized the older woman’s hand with an appealing
grasp.</p>

<p>Betsy gave her one-sided smile, and Rosalie’s
eyes filled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“You don’t seem surprised!” she said
unsteadily.</p>

<p>“I am, though,” returned Betsy. “I supposed
we’d left you behind at Norris.”</p>

<p>“You saw me there! Did the—did Mrs.
Bruce?”</p>

<p>Betsy shook her head. “No; and she hasn’t
yet; but I was thinkin’ about you as we came
up to the stage, and when all of a sudden I
saw you, I thought I’d get in here.”</p>

<p>The Nixon party were directly in front of
them, and the Bruces in the next seat, and all
were conversing busily among themselves.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad to see you, Betsy, that I can
hardly bear it;” and a bright tear rolled swiftly
down Rosalie’s cheek, as she leaned back in
her corner to regain her self-control.</p>

<p>“I’ve thought about you considerable,”
returned Betsy, “and I haven’t been any too
easy.”</p>

<p>“I told Mrs. Pogram, I promised her, that if
I were in any trouble I would write. How kind
of you!” with a sudden burst of gratitude and
a continued clinging to Betsy’s slender fingers.
“How kind of you to care!”</p>

<p>“Of course I cared, child,” returned the
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you saw me being a waitress!”</p>

<p>“Yes. First-rate idea for college boys,”
answered Betsy quietly. “It’s quite the
fashion for a lot of ’em to help themselves
through school that way. I don’t know about
it exactly for girls in a strange land,—little
country girls that don’t know anything about
the world; I don’t know whether I like it or
not.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good way to see the world,” said
Rosalie, without enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Yes; and ain’t it a beautiful one out here?
Is that what you did it for, Rosalie?”</p>

<p>“Partly—not exactly. I was getting away
from Loomis.”</p>

<p>Betsy nodded. “I heard he pestered you.”</p>

<p>Rosalie looked off reminiscently. “I didn’t
tell Auntie Pogram, because I didn’t want to
hurt her feelings; but the reason Loomis began
being so unkind to me was because I wouldn’t
marry him.”</p>

<p>“I suspected as much,” said Betsy.</p>

<p>“So long as he was Auntie Pogram’s brother
I knew there was no hope of escaping him if
I stayed there, and so—I ran away. It was
selfish. My conscience has never felt easy;
but I couldn’t endure his insults.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose not,” returned Betsy. Her tone
was quiet, but there were sparks in her usually
inexpressive eyes, and had Loomis Brown
suddenly appeared it might have gone ill with
his rapidly thinning hair.</p>

<p>“What did you do? How did you manage
to get so far from home?” continued Betsy.</p>

<p>“I first went to a boarding-house that I
knew of in Portland, and there I met a lady
who had been taken ill and wanted to go back
to her home in Chicago; but she had a little
child and didn’t feel able to travel with him
alone; so she agreed to pay my fare to Chicago
if I would help her home. I didn’t know how
I would ever get back, but it was getting away
from Loomis, so I went. On the train I met
a woman who spoke of a place in Chicago
where they took girls to wait on table in the
Yellowstone; so as soon as I could, I applied,
and they took me and sent me out here.”</p>

<p>“And do you like it?” asked Betsy, eyeing
the mignonne face closely.</p>

<p>“No, of course I don’t like it, exactly, and
I’ve been frightened ever since I saw you all
at the Mammoth Hot Springs, for I was sure
Mrs. Bruce would be disgusted with me. She
expected me to make some use of her kindness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” returned Betsy dryly.
“She’s short-sighted, and ten to one she won’t
see you; and if she does, she probably won’t
remember you.”</p>

<p>“I may yet, you know,” said Rosalie
eagerly, “I may yet reward her kindness; but
I had no money, so I couldn’t stop to see
about any school position; and besides, Loomis
lives in Portland.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t bother about him,” said Betsy
carelessly. “One donkey more or less that
you meet in the street isn’t goin’ to affect
you. He’ll be busy wavin’ his long ears at
Mrs. Pogram’s new help; for she’ll have to get
somebody. I went to see her just before we
left, and heard the whole story.”</p>

<p>Rosalie laughed softly, and her eyes filled
again. “O Betsy, it’s so long since I laughed!”
she said; and her tone was so earnest and sad
that Betsy averted her head and saw the
scenery through a blur. “I was in the stage
all this morning. It’s a wonder you didn’t
feel how longingly I looked at the back of your
head.”</p>

<p>“You were?” asked Betsy, surprised. “Are
you goin’ with us all the way?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I may be left anywhere. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
thought I had left you this time and hoped
so, Betsy, because I was afraid of Mrs. Bruce;
but oh, how glad I am now! for it’s such a
comfort to see you, since you’re not angry
with me.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” replied Miss Foster, going to
the length of patting the hand that held hers.
“I would be, though, if you’d gone off and
didn’t write me or let me know where you
were; but you didn’t know that we were
home.”</p>

<p>“No. That’s why I was so startled to see
you at the Hot Springs. I had thought I was
thousands of miles from any one who knew me.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t lose track of you again,” declared
Betsy quietly.</p>

<p>“O Betsy, do you care?” The girl drew
closer to her neighbor’s angular shoulder. The
expression in her lovely eyes disconcerted
Betsy as she met it. “There isn’t any one else
in the world to care. I’ve had lots of time
since I left Chicago to think how alone I am,
and I’ve been as disappointed in myself as
Mrs. Bruce could be because I’m not brave
about it. There have been moments at night
when I was sorry, Loomis and all, that I ever
left Fairport.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Betsy patted the hand again. “I do care,
Rosalie. I won’t ask you to promise me,
because if you need to be bound by a promise
you don’t want me for a friend; but I tell you
now that I expect you to keep in touch with
me. I wish I could stay by you or keep you
near me, but I can’t. I can, though, be some
help to you perhaps, one way or another, and
I’ll be glad to have you feel that way, and
never get into a tight place without letting me
know.”</p>

<p>“I do promise, Betsy, so gratefully,” began
Rosalie; and then Mr. Derwent turned around
and met her eyes with a kind smile in his.
He indicated a point in the woods. Rosalie
looked and descried the spreading antlers of a
deer, which stood bright-eyed and motionless
in the shadow and watched the stage go by.
Mr. Derwent had been the first to discover the
animal, but soon everybody in the stage was
alert.</p>

<p>“Oh, the deer! Look at the deer!” sped
from mouth to mouth.</p>

<p>“What a sermon to men-folks!” exclaimed
Betsy. “The way the critters act in this Park
is a wonder, just because men’s savage instincts
are restrained.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Rosalie. “I’ve been saying to
myself over and over Emerson’s poem,—</p>

<p class="center">
‘Who hath named the birds without a gun?’”<br />
</p>

<p>Betsy regarded her with the one-sided smile.</p>

<p>“Still speak poetry, do you, even though
you do bring folks their soup?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.” Rosalie gave her head a sad
little shake. “When I stop thinking and feeling
poetry, I shall have stopped breathing.”</p>

<p>Everybody was commenting on the curious
action of the beautiful wild creature in the
forest, Robert declaring that he had buck
fever.</p>

<p>When the excitement had subsided, he
leaned forward to Irving’s ear.</p>

<p>“Your faithful retainer has found her
tongue,” he said. “She and Uncle Henry’s
Hebe are talking thirteen to the dozen.”</p>

<p>“Has Mr. Derwent a Hebe on board?”</p>

<p>“Yes. A genius who has brought him good
coffee for two meals. Watch him head for her
table this noon; and she’s unnecessarily
pretty.”</p>

<p>Upon this Irving turned around and caught
Betsy’s eye; then a glimpse of the blond young
girl who was her companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Glad she’s having a good time,” he said,
turning back. Then to Mrs. Bruce, “Betsy
has made friends with a pretty waitress back
there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we still have the domestics, the heavers,
with us, have we?” laughed Mrs. Bruce.</p>

<p>“Is that what they call them!” exclaimed
Robert alertly, but continuing to speak softly.
“Didn’t you see the other one we had this
morning? The spearmint expert? Alas, she
is no more; but if this one had stayed, I can
tell you Uncle Henry would have stayed too.”</p>

<p>“O Robert!” exclaimed Mrs. Nixon, anxious
to make a diversion, “could you get me some
of that very peculiar red flower?”</p>

<p>The stage was climbing a gentle incline and
Robert swung himself out and gathered the
blossoms.</p>

<p>“Want some?” asked Irving of his companion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce certainly did, and Irving accordingly
jumped out, also. She turned to Mrs.
Nixon, smiling.</p>

<p>“We’re pretty fortunate women,” she said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon sighed. “Robert is such a scatterbrain,”
she returned.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce continued her glance around,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
curious to see the waitress who had been the
subject of remark. She saw a fair young girl
wearing a veil; but her near-sighted glance
awakened no memory.</p>

<p>“I’m glad,” she thought, “that Betsy has
some one to talk to.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>THE FOUNTAIN HOUSE</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was late and cold when the party reached
the Fountain House, and the big open fire
burning in the office was a welcome sight.</p>

<p>Robert Nixon’s prophecy was fulfilled, and
Mr. Derwent managed to be waited upon by
Rosalie at supper. The Bruce party happened
to sit with their backs to that table, and indeed
Betsy did not expect either of her companions
to recognize the girl in this place and
position so remote from the spot where they
had known her but slightly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pogram had often in past days spoken
to Betsy of her husband’s distant relatives
the Vincents, once wealthy and highly placed,
then reduced to financial ruin, illness, and
death, leaving this pretty blossom alone on
the family tree. The good lady had often
mentioned, as being to Rosalie’s credit, that
she was without false pride or foolish reverting
to the past of her luxurious childhood; and
the situation had appealed to whatever was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
romantic in Betsy Foster’s breast. There had
always been for her some atmosphere about
Rosalie Vincent as of the exiled Princess in
servitude, and the sweetness with which the
girl undertook Mrs. Pogram’s drudgery had
oftentimes excited an admiration in Betsy
which she never put into words.</p>

<p>She fought now with a sense of pathos that
Rosalie should be hurrying back and forth
under the orders of hungry travelers.</p>

<p>Irving commented at supper upon Betsy’s
sociability with the pretty waitress in the
stage, and some instinct bade the good woman
guard her secret.</p>

<p>“She is a very intelligent girl,” Betsy replied.
“It seems it’s quite a common thing
for nice poor girls to see the Park in this way.”</p>

<p>“A very good idea, too,” remarked Mrs.
Bruce. “Just as the college boys wait on
table in the White Mountain resorts.”</p>

<p>Betsy breathed more freely. If Mrs. Bruce
were going to approve this move of Rosalie’s,
it would be a relief. Fully able to fight her
own battles, she shrank sensitively from hearing
this girl discussed and criticised.</p>

<p>“That’s what I say, too,” she returned.
“I think it shows good courage in a girl to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
strike out and see something of the world.
It shows character and enterprise.”</p>

<p>Irving looked at his old friend curiously.
It was unlike her to express so much. It was
some embarrassment to Betsy to take her
meals with her employers, as the herding
together of crowds for food on this trip made
necessary; and this was the first time she had
opened her lips voluntarily at table.</p>

<p>In the mean time Rosalie was again winning
laurels from the Nixons, and Helen Maynard
looked up at her as she gave her orders.</p>

<p>When the party left the table, Helen lagged
behind.</p>

<p>“Miss Vincent, Rosalie,” she said low to the
waitress, “don’t you remember me at Lambeth?”</p>

<p>Rosalie colored.</p>

<p>“Yes; but please don’t remember me!” she
returned.</p>

<p>Helen eyed her sharply.</p>

<p>“I mean it,” said Rosalie. “You’re very
kind, but I’ll tell you some time.”</p>

<p>She turned away, and Robert Nixon advanced
toward them.</p>

<p>“Pardon me, Miss Maynard, I thought you
were ahead of me.” Then when they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
moved toward the door, he laughed. “Have
you caught the infection? Mother is gravely
considering getting the girl’s address and
having her come to Boston.”</p>

<p>“She blushed like the traditional rose when I
spoke to her,” returned Helen, and said no more.</p>

<p>The recognition of her school-friend put
Rosalie in a new flutter; and yet such was the
joy of sitting on the back seat of the stage with
Betsy that she had not the heart to hope for
orders to stay at the Fountain House.</p>

<p>For the hundredth time she calculated what
money Mrs. Bruce had expended on her course
in English, and for the hundredth time felt
herself wither under the scorn of that lady’s
eyes should she recognize her and discover
that, after all, she had not been able to rise
above the level where she was found.</p>

<p>“If I could only pay her! If I could only
pay her!” sang through the girl’s head like
an ever-recurring refrain.</p>

<p>The sudden announcement that the Fountain
Geyser was about to play caused a stampede
among the guests of the hotel, and everybody
who had wraps to withstand the cold
of the July evening hastened out to be in time
for the show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce was greatly excited. “It’s a
shame, a perfect shame that the Company
don’t warn people to bring flannels and furs,”
she said. “Even my sweater feels like muslin.”</p>

<p>“You’re going to wear my overcoat, Madama,”
said Irving, beginning to put it about her.</p>

<p>“No indeed, Mr. Irving,” burst forth Betsy,
and was rewarded by a flash behind Mrs.
Bruce’s eyeglasses.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose I should allow him,
Betsy? What are you thinking of!”</p>

<p>As she spoke sharply, the offended woman
drew away from her son, and Betsy hastened
to mollify her.</p>

<p>“I’m going to wrap you up in my things,
Mrs. Bruce,” she said.</p>

<p>The lady made a faint protest.</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am, you let me, because you
couldn’t drag me away from this fire anyway.
I’d rather see flames spout than water to-night.”</p>

<p>Irving frowned. “You didn’t come across
the continent for that, Betsy,” he began.</p>

<p>She gave him her one-sided smile. “I came
across the continent because I had to,” she
returned, meanwhile making her slender mistress
shapeless under a large golf-cape. “I’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
been readin’ the guide-book; and I’ve got
lots o’ geysers comin’ to me yet.”</p>

<p>“I do think,” said Mrs. Bruce, when she
and Irving were out of doors and hastening
on their way to the widespread crust of the
formation, “I do think Betsy might be more
appreciative of her advantages. Almost any
one else would value more the privilege of a
visit to the Yellowstone.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Irving dryly, “and the
more the other one appreciated it, the less
she’d lend you her golf-cape.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce looked at him. “You always
take Betsy’s part!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I’m only showing you that you chose your
companion wisely,” was the quiet reply.
“There, Madama, it’s beginning. Can you
sprint?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce could sprint with any girl that
lived, and they were soon on the outskirts
of the shivering, eager crowd, and Mrs. Bruce
was making little ineffectual hops in the endeavor
to see over and between the heads of
those in front of her. But instantly the fountain
shot into the air and played in the mysterious
twilight under a cold pale moon, and
a hush fell upon all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Betsy had the open fire practically to herself;
and she sat before it, ruminating deeply.
It seemed strange to think of Rosalie so near
and yet so far. How she longed to get out into
that forbidden department and lend the aid
of her capable hands to whatever work the
young girl was doing. She wondered what a
day would bring forth. Possibly she should
not see Rosalie again; and if the girl were sent
on with them to-morrow to the Old Faithful
Inn, she knew that the Bruces’ plan was to
remain there for a few days, and there she
would doubtless lose her definitely.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bruce used to call her her protégée!”
she thought. A long determined breath came
from Betsy’s breast. “She’s goin’ to be Betsy
Foster’s protégée now, and I ain’t goin’ to lose
sight of her.”</p>

<p>She continued to look thoughtfully into the
leaping flames, and even her practical common
sense was not proof against their age-long
ability to show the gazer alluring possibilities.</p>

<p>A certain rough seaman mending his sail
in far-off Yankee land little realized that,
could his canvas be turned into a magic
carpet, this was his psychological moment.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” Betsy was reflecting, “’tain’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Mrs. Pogram’s fault that she hasn’t as much
backbone as a jelly-fish.”</p>

<p>A broad, strong flame flew squarely up
toward the chimney. “I suppose if—if I
ever was—soft enough—to— Well, Hiram’s
a good soul. He’d be kind as any father to
Rosalie.”</p>

<p>Betsy suddenly realized that the fire was
making her face hot, and she put up her hand
to shield it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile Hiram Salter was placidly sitting
cross-legged over his prostrate sail. A
piece of twine held in his lips fell down each
side of his chin, giving him some resemblance
to a gigantic catfish.</p>

<p>A few days later he received a picture-postal
from the Fountain House Hotel in the
Yellowstone. It was dated on the evening when
Betsy sat so long before the fire; and it read,—</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<span class="smcap">Dear H.</span>:<br />
<p>Cold as Xmas here.</p>
<div class="sig">B. F.<br />
</div></div>

<p>And the good man never suspected that in
reality it had never been as little cold for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
in all his years of courtship as on the evening
when that postal card was bought; and that
in place of the curt message might truly have
run a bit from Rosalie Vincent’s repertoire:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Never the time and the place,</div>
<div class="verse">And the loved one, all together.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The next morning dawned bright. If Rosalie
was in the breakfast-room, Betsy did not
see her.</p>

<p>When later she entered the back seat of
the last stage, Betsy looked about anxiously.
Irving came to the step.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bruce and Nixie are up there with
the driver. I’m coming in with you,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Just wait one minute, Mr. Irving,” returned
Betsy. “If—if that young—waitress
is going along with us, she’d feel—sort of
embarrassed if—”</p>

<p>“Well—well,”—Irving looked up into
the narrow face and laughed,—“this is the
first time you ever turned me down.”</p>

<p>He looked about. Mrs. Nixon, Miss Maynard,
and Mr. Derwent were in the middle
seat as before. The stout gentleman and
another man were in the seat in front of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you’d put me in there with four hundred
pounds of tourist?” went on Irving.
“Nay, nay, Betsy. I’ll get over there in the
corner beyond you and promise to keep my
place.”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’re going to start,” said Betsy
in trepidation, “and—and she isn’t here.
Couldn’t you get him to wait, Mr. Irving?
I—”</p>

<p>Irving swung into the stage as the horses
moved.</p>

<p>“My dear Betsy, we’ve ceased to be individuals.
We’re part of a system,” he said as
he seated himself beside her. “When the Park
authorities say this stage moves, it moves.”</p>

<p>Betsy leaned back, her lip caught under her
teeth and her expression so abstracted that
Irving stared at her curiously.</p>

<p>“I do believe,” he said incredulously, “that
Betsy Foster, clever Betsy, has fallen in love.”</p>

<p>“How you talk!” returned his companion,
recovering herself; and being quite conscious
of Rosalie and a little conscious of her fire-lit
fancies, an astonishing color rose under her
sallow skin.</p>

<p>Irving laughed. “After all these years,
our sedate Betsy—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“How you act, Mr. Irving!”</p>

<p>The speaker tried not to smile, but continued
to look so guilty and red-faced that Irving’s
laughter grew.</p>

<p>“After all these years; the heart that I
thought was mine—given to a heaver!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to have said good-by to her,”
said Betsy. “She’s—she ain’t the—the
independent kind—and I—”</p>

<p>Irving looked at her kindly. “How does
that big heart of yours find room in that
slender body?” he asked. “Cats and dogs
and horses and humans—it’s all one to you.
You’ve taken a brief to defend them all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Irving!”—Betsy looked off at the
landscape,—“if I could defend them all!”</p>

<p>“Why that tragic look?”</p>

<p>“Your words made me think again, as I
so often do, that in a world full of so much
beauty as this, people are cuttin’ up live
animals in the name of science, and the law
permits it.”</p>

<p>Irving shook his head. He had heard before
Betsy’s horror-stricken views of vivisection.</p>

<p>“Human life is the most precious of all,”
he reminded her, now.</p>

<p>“Yes, but don’t just as fine physicians as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
any say that the unnatural conditions in vivisection
prevent any good coming from it?
Yes, they do; and supposing it <i>did</i> do any
good! Don’t most civilized people believe in
an after-life? If they’re going to live to eternity
anyway, and have got to pass through death
some time, how can they be willing to have
their lives in this world prolonged a few years
at the cost of torturing innocent animals?
That’s what I say. How <i>can</i> they—and then
expect any heaven awaits <i>them</i>?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t thought much about it,” said
Irving.</p>

<p>“Well, think now, then!” returned Betsy.
“I know <i>I</i>’d rather die any time than have a
live dog cut up on the chance of helping to
keep me here a little longer; and I shouldn’t
dare show myself before the Maker of the
dog if I wouldn’t! And everybody who doesn’t
vote against it, and work against it, deserves
to see their own pets on the rack. I
guess that would bring it home to them!”</p>

<p>Betsy winked hard as she finished, and
Irving patted her slight shoulder.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest doubt that you’re
right, Betsy, but for a few days we can’t do
anything about it; and now let’s talk about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
something that makes you happy—heavers,
for instance.”</p>

<p>Betsy’s usually inexpressive eyes had a
wistfulness in them as she turned toward the
strong face she loved. “I can’t bear to have
her any place where she could be called a
heaver!” she responded.</p>

<p>“That young woman must be a wonder,”
said Irving. “She’s the first, I’ll wager, to
make a conquest of Betsy Foster in one day!”</p>

<p>“Your mother’s about the only one that
ever did that, Mr. Irving.”</p>

<p>Betsy’s eyes fell upon a chipmunk by the
roadside, sitting up and clasping its hands
under its chin in the customary admiration
of the stage.</p>

<p>“See that little critter?” she continued.
“This girl is just as innocent as that chipmunk,
and knows just as much o’ the ways o’ the
world. It goes by her; and though her heart
sort o’ comes up in her throat, she cheers up
under the least kindness and is willin’ to
admire everything and everybody.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! What an impression in one
day on my unimpressionable Betsy!” Irving
smiled, genuinely surprised by this unprecedented
interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“That girl was the child o’ luxury,” went
on his companion,—“lost everything, parents
included, and came to be practically a servant
in the home of a poor relation. Got so persecuted
by the attentions of a skinflint man who
wanted her to be <i>his</i> drudge that she ran
away, and somehow drifted into waitin’ on
hungry folks in the Yellowstone!”</p>

<p>Irving smiled. “She told a story well,
anyway. She has missed her vocation. Some
one ought to tell her the pen is mightier than
the knife and fork.”</p>

<p>“It’s easy to tell the truth,” returned
Betsy, nettled by his tone.</p>

<p>Irving laughed. “For Clever Betsy, I do
believe; but for most people always difficult,
and usually unsafe.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” returned his companion, “this girl
was tellin’ the truth and I know it.”</p>

<p>Here the stage stopped and the passengers
dismounted to see a pool of great beauty
which was out of sight from the road; and
when they returned, Betsy’s abstraction had
vanished; and although she evidently enjoyed
Irving’s companionship on the long drive,
not another word on the subject of her companion
of yesterday could be elicited from her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Once Mr. Derwent turned around and met
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Where is your young friend?” he asked.</p>

<p>Betsy shook her head. “She didn’t come,”
she answered.</p>

<p>They had reached a point where the road
forked; and Betsy’s glance was arrested by a
sign placed at the point of divergence. It
read:—</p>

<p>“All loose and pack animals take this road.”</p>

<p>Her lips twitched as she turned toward
Irving.</p>

<p>“Do you s’pose,” she asked, “that all the
loose and pack animals can read that?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>ON THE RIVERSIDE</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Pools</span> of heavenly tints; living emerald, and
beryl; boiling springs, the scalding water
bubbling with intense force; Nature’s wonders
ever varied, entertained the party on their
way to the Old Faithful Inn,—the luxurious
log-cabin of the Yellowstone.</p>

<p>Arrived there, each one took a long breath
as if it were a Mecca reached. The examination
of the curious and fascinating structure,
with the woodsy green furnishings of the log
bedrooms, which carried out the sylvan idea
in all possible particulars, entertained the
tourists until they were admitted to the dining-room.</p>

<p>Betsy looked with rather sad eyes upon the
waitresses, and suddenly her heart gave a
little jump, for unless those eyes deceived
her, Rosalie Vincent was tripping busily about
at the other end of the room.</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent did not espy her evidently,
for he led his party to another table, and the
Bruces stopped halfway down the room. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
a word said Betsy, but her slow color rose.
The crowd was great at this favorite place.
Rosalie had evidently been sent on by the
earliest stage, and Betsy shrewdly suspected
that she would be kept here. She began planning
at once an evening’s visit with the girl.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce was delighted with the novelty
of the Inn and so far had not suggested any
improvements.</p>

<p>“We must drive right after dinner to some
of these wonderful places,” she said. “Isn’t
it restful to think we haven’t to rush about
and freeze to see Old Faithful, because it’s so
regular! It’s a pity, though, that it doesn’t
play exactly every hour. There’s five minutes
or ten minutes over that you always have to
remember.”</p>

<p>Irving shook his head. “These careless
authorities,” he said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce shrugged her shoulders. “I’m
sure that was a very innocent remark,” she
retorted.</p>

<p>“Innocent to simplicity, Madama; but remember
what you lose in convenience by the
present schedule, you gain in mathematical
exercise.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t come out here for mathematical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
exercise,” began Mrs. Bruce; and went on
to comment on some of the beauties of the
morning drive; but Irving lost the thread of
her remarks, for he happened to catch sight
of Rosalie Vincent, and looked again more
closely.</p>

<p>Not to interrupt Mrs. Bruce’s eulogies, he
touched Betsy’s hand and motioned with his
head toward the blonde waitress.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that the loved and lost?” he asked
softly.</p>

<p>Betsy looked nonchalantly in the direction
he indicated. “Why, so ’tis,” she said
quietly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce turned her eyeglasses upon
them. “Of course if you and Betsy want to
talk, don’t mind interrupting me.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Madama. I’ve been drying Betsy’s
tears all the morning shed for the loss
of her blonde heaver; and I just discovered
her, that’s all. You’ll excuse me, won’t you?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce peered near-sightedly down the
hall, but saw nothing nearly so interesting as
her soup, so returned to it.</p>

<p>Betsy waited for Irving’s next words, expecting
they might be of recognition; but he
went on eating, as he added:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’d better make it a point to see her,
this trip, and tell her to try her hand at a
pathetic tale for the Maiden’s Home Companion!”</p>

<p>Betsy gave a one-sided smile of relief. “Mrs.
Bruce, you indulged this young man too much
a spell back. He’d ought to been disciplined
’fore ’twas too late.”</p>

<p>“That from you!” returned Mrs. Bruce
complacently. “You never wanted me even
to contradict him.”</p>

<p>After dinner the men of the party put the
four women into a wagon, whose driver was
warranted to let Mrs. Bruce lose nothing
which could be seen and heard in one afternoon,
and started off for a tramp.</p>

<p>Their first pause was at the exquisite liquid
flower known as the Morning Glory Pool. The
wondrous color and shape of this spring held
them long. Some one, either with a wish to
test its depth, or desiring to furnish the blue
morning glory with a pistil, had dropped a
stick into its centre.</p>

<p>Irving smiled at his own thoughts. “The
driver is lucky if Madama doesn’t make him
get out and fish for that stick,” he thought.</p>

<p>After their ramble of an hour the friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
halted near the Riverside Geyser, where the
gathering crowd indicated that it would soon
spout.</p>

<p>In moving about for desirable points of
vantage, Mr. Derwent and Robert Nixon
became separated from Irving, who from his
greater height was satisfied with his position
behind a knot of persons on the river bank.
Among them was a young girl with her back
to him. She was bareheaded and wore a white
gown. Irving looked twice idly at her because
her hair was pretty, and then noticed that a
couple of soldiers, off duty, spoke to her and
that she tried to repel them.</p>

<p>“Come now, Goldilocks,” said one of them
ingratiatingly, in his hoarse voice, “wasn’t
I introduced to you all right at Norris? Don’t
be stuck up.”</p>

<p>He came closer, with open admiration. The
girl made some soft reply, then turned, and
there was no mistaking the look, half of annoyance
and half of fear, in her childlike face.</p>

<p>Irving stepped forward instinctively, and
recognized Betsy’s friend. He had noticed
in the dining-room that the girl bore a resemblance
to some one he had seen, but he had
not been able to locate it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“O Mr. Bruce!” she ejaculated involuntarily,
coming nearer as if for protection.</p>

<p>The soldiers saw him lift his hat, and fell
back.</p>

<p>“Rosalie—Miss Vincent—is it you?”
said Irving, all Betsy’s interest and concern
explained in a flash.</p>

<p>She shrank away. “I—I didn’t mean to
speak to you,” she said naïvely; and she cast
down her eyes with an expression which sent
a thrill of compassion across the man’s heart-strings.
He remembered Mrs. Pogram’s lachrymose
tale, and Betsy’s romance of the
morning. “I was afraid Mrs. Bruce would be
offended to find me here, after all she has done
for me,” went on Rosalie, her heart beating
fast; “but—but I couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p>The artless words and the graceful, culprit
attitude were appealing.</p>

<p>“I saw you in the dining-room, but didn’t
remember you at first,” answered Irving. “I
dare say you wouldn’t have chosen this work,
but I hope you are getting some pleasure out
of it.”</p>

<p>Rosalie shook her head. “It is very beautiful,
and—and it wouldn’t be lonely if there
weren’t any—any people about; but I don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
know how to get on very well with—with
the others.”</p>

<p>Irving glanced over toward the young
soldiers who were alive to Rosalie’s tête-à-tête.
He could imagine that this golden head, on
which the mountain sun was glinting, would
be a shining mark for local admiration. Betsy’s
disturbed feeling was becoming better
understood with every moment.</p>

<p>“I had an hour to myself and I wanted so
much to see this geyser play. I didn’t wait for
my hat or anything. I just ran.” Rosalie put
her hand to her bare head, apologetically.</p>

<p>“I’ve great curiosity to see this one, too,”
replied Irving. “Why don’t we sit down till
the show begins?” He indicated a spot on the
greensward where a tree cast its shadow, for
the afternoon sun was ardent.</p>

<p>“Please don’t think you must stay with
me,” responded the girl, with a timid, grateful
smile which made her prettier than ever.
“I’m not really at all afraid of those soldiers.
Perhaps I did meet them with a waitress at
Norris who knows them all; and they don’t
mean any harm.”</p>

<p>“I dare say not; but sit down, Miss Rosalie.
It’s as good a place to wait as any.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>So she obeyed, quite frightened and happy.
Frightened because she did not know what moment
her powerful benefactress might appear
on the scene, and happy because—because—well,
she had during two whole seasons
admired Irving Bruce from afar and looked
very wistfully at the girls who shared his summer
fun; and now he was disposing his large
person near her on the grass as if it were the
most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>“You and Betsy Foster had a long séance
yesterday in the stage, didn’t you?” he said,
leaning on his elbow and looking up into the
blue eyes that he could see were not quite at
ease.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed. Oh, what it was to get hold
of Betsy’s hand and sit beside her all the
morning!”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t she tell Mrs. Bruce and me
that one of our old neighbors was in our
party?”</p>

<p>“She knew,” Rosalie flushed, “that I
dreaded to have Mrs. Bruce know it.”</p>

<p>“Why? I can’t imagine why.”</p>

<p>“Because Mrs. Bruce helped me so much,
and meant me to do something so different.
She gave me a course in English in the fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
school at Lambeth, and she had a right to
expect I would be teaching, and doing her
kindness credit.”</p>

<p>“Time enough for that in the fall, I should
think.”</p>

<p>“But I haven’t any position. I had no
way to—to live until—I could get one.”
The speaker averted her face, not so quickly
but that Irving saw the blue eyes were swimming.</p>

<p>Had Rosalie been the most artful of girls
she could not have planned words and actions
more effective to win the championship of
Mrs. Bruce’s son, knowing as he did the history
of her flight.</p>

<p>“I met Mrs. Pogram a few weeks ago in
Fairport,” he replied. “She told me of her
loss of you.”</p>

<p>Rosalie did not speak. She furtively wiped
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Does Mrs. Pogram know where you are?”</p>

<p>“No. It seems unkind, for I know she is
fond of me; but I promised her that if I were
in any trouble I would write her; and if she
knew where I was, her brother would know,
and I—I can’t endure him!” The girl finished
with a flash of energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“You show faultless taste,” returned Irving.
“Don’t be afraid of Mrs. Bruce. She won’t
expect you to be teaching English in the
Yellowstone.”</p>

<p>“They have an English of their own,” returned
Rosalie. “Probably if you knew what
I am, you wouldn’t be talking to me as if I
were a summer girl.”</p>

<p>Her faint smile suddenly shone upon him,
for she felt he meant to placate Mrs. Bruce.</p>

<p>Irving laughed. “I do know something of
the Park lingo. You’re taking another course
in English, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am.”</p>

<p>Rosalie suddenly thought of Miss Hickey
and wondered what that young person would
say if clairvoyance could show her this picture
on the river bank.</p>

<p>“What are your plans, if it’s a fair question?”
Irving asked.</p>

<p>“I haven’t any, Mr. Bruce.” Again the
anxious look in the blue eyes. “Of course, I
finish the season in the Park. If I don’t, I
forfeit my expenses being paid to return.”</p>

<p>“Did they bring you ’way from Portland?”</p>

<p>“No, from Chicago.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Irving raised his eyebrows, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
asked no question. “You mustn’t let us lose
sight of you,” he added.</p>

<p>“That’s very kind. What I have felt was
that I mustn’t let you catch sight of me,”
returned the girl naïvely. “I wasn’t afraid of
you, Mr. Bruce, for I didn’t think you’d
remember me at all; and—I do so appreciate
your kindness.”</p>

<p>Irving looked at her with considering eyes.
Her half-timid, half-respectful manner was
novel, and the little burst of gratitude with
which she finished was most agreeable. He
recalled that Betsy had said that this girl,
apparently so alone in the world, had been
born and reared in luxury. With the eye of
a connoisseur he regarded her now, and pictured
what a triumphant march her girlhood
would have been had she remained in the class
of Fortune’s favorites.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Derwent and Robert Nixon,
threading their way among the waiting knots
of sightseers, approached the spot where the
above conversation was taking place.</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent was first to perceive the pair.</p>

<p>“See there, Robert,” he said, with his crisp,
short manner of speech. “I think we’ve seen
only one head that matches the Yellowstone?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>His nephew followed the direction of the
other’s fixed gaze.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll—be—” he began, “if there
isn’t Brute, fussing our heaver.”</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent laid a restraining hand on the
arm of his companion, who made an instant
move in his friend’s direction.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” replied Robert, close to
his uncle’s ear. “It’s up to us to rescue her.
She isn’t <i>his</i> heaver.”</p>

<p>“She doesn’t look as if she wished to be
rescued,” remarked Mr. Derwent; and the
concern in his face moved his irreverent
nephew to merriment.</p>

<p>“You see Hebe isn’t a goddess, after all,”
he remarked into the rubber device which
hung about his uncle’s neck. “Just a nice,
every-day heaver; and her hair’s caught Brute.
Let’s go and see.”</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent’s face was impassive as he
followed. The childlike eyes and the modest
demeanor of the pretty waitress had greatly attracted
him. He was sorry to find her like this.</p>

<p>Bruce sprang to his feet as they approached.
He read mischief in Robert’s eyes, and his own
were unresponsive.</p>

<p>Robert nodded and grinned cheerfully at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Rosalie before Irving could get possession of
what Robert termed his uncle’s rubber ear.
Then he said with a distinctness intended to
awe and repress Nixie, “I have found an old
friend, Mr. Derwent. A young lady whose
home is where we go in summer. Let me present
you to Miss Vincent.”</p>

<p>Robert reconstructed his countenance as
well as he could, and Mr. Derwent’s face
cleared as he raised his hat. “Mr. Nixon,
Miss Vincent,” went on Irving severely.</p>

<p>“I have waited on these gentlemen,” said
the girl, looking at Mr. Derwent.</p>

<p>“You deserted our stage this morning,”
he answered, and deliberately dropped upon
the grass beside Rosalie, while she explained,
blushing, how she had been hurried on early
because of the crowds.</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said Robert aside to Irving. “Old
friend of yours?” He snapped his fingers.
“Piffle! Likewise gammon. She’s fed us for
two days.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear it,” responded Irving
stiffly. “Otherwise I couldn’t quite understand
your greeting of her as you came up.”</p>

<p>Robert laughed unrestrainedly. “Just got
off with my skin, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“She’s all alone out here,” said Irving,
flushing under the sincerity of his friend’s
merriment, but continuing to scowl.</p>

<p>“She is, eh?” returned Nixie. “Then all
I have to say is she must be the author of that
spooky declaration, ‘I’m never less alone than
when alone.’ See there,” motioning with his
head toward an advancing group of women,
“there come the rest of us. We can’t lose ’em.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>FACE TO FACE</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> ladies had left their wagon, to move
about and break the long drive by the view of
the Riverside Geyser in action. As they approached
their friends, Mrs. Nixon put up her
lorgnette.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that my brother sitting there on the
grass?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Certainly it is, and there are the boys,”
rejoined Mrs. Bruce with satisfaction, hastening
her steps.</p>

<p>Behind them followed Betsy Foster and
Miss Maynard.</p>

<p>“To whom is Henry talking?” asked Mrs.
Nixon. “Why,—why, Mrs. Bruce! I never
knew him to do anything so strange! It’s that
waitress—that waitress that came on with
us in the stage.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t notice her,” returned Mrs. Bruce.
“I was always sitting in front.”</p>

<p>“She has waited on us at the hotels,” said
Mrs. Nixon, and her tone grew colder. “Men
are so thoughtless. I liked the girl so much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
I was seriously thinking of making an arrangement
with her for the fall—”</p>

<p>Here, as they had come within speaking distance,
Mrs. Nixon’s lips closed. Mr. Derwent’s
necessarily devoted attitude as he now
tried to catch something Rosalie was saying
settled the matter with Mrs. Nixon, and lost
the girl her chance of an assured winter home.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce stared curiously at the bare
golden head; and Miss Maynard and Betsy,
following, descried Mr. Derwent and the
waitress at the same moment.</p>

<p>“Rosalie!” said Helen Maynard, under her
breath.</p>

<p>“Do you know her?” asked Betsy, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes. We were at school together.”</p>

<p>Betsy’s footsteps quickened, for she felt
vaguely that Rosalie might indeed need protection
now.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce began speaking with her usual
energy.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad we’re in time, Irving. I told
that driver if he didn’t get us back at the right
moment to see this geyser play, he’d never be
forgiven. We’ve been to the oddest place
called Biscuit Basin; a great pool just covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
with nicely browned biscuit. It made one
hungry to look at them. But the hot water
we splashed through to get there! I shall be
boiled yet in this place.”</p>

<p>The moment Rosalie caught sight of Mrs.
Bruce, she sprang to her feet with supple
swiftness. Mr. Derwent deliberately arose
and met his sister’s disapproving eyes imperturbably.
He put on the hat which for coolness
he had been holding on his knee.</p>

<p>Rosalie flushed and paled and met Betsy’s
eyes so entreatingly that the latter stepped
forward by her employer’s side.</p>

<p>At that moment Mrs. Bruce for the first
time gave her attention to the young girl.</p>

<p>“Why!” she said, and hesitated.</p>

<p>Irving knew that she was trying to place
the memory of an individual who had once
interested her.</p>

<p>“It is Miss Rosalie Vincent, Madama,” he
said quietly. “She surprised me a few minutes
ago.”</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> Rosalie,” said Mrs. Bruce; and approaching,
she shook hands with the girl she
had befriended. In the same moment her
alert mind recalled all that Mrs. Nixon had
just said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>A waitress. The waitress who had traveled
in their stage. The waitress with whom Betsy
had talked yesterday.</p>

<p>Her manner cooled. The pupils of her eyes
narrowed.</p>

<p>“I am surprised to see you here,” she said.</p>

<p>“I knew you would be,” was all the girl
could answer, and her face burned.</p>

<p>Betsy spoke. “You wondered where her
wings would carry her, Mrs. Bruce, and now
you see. Good strong wings, you’ll agree, to
go ’way across the continent.”</p>

<p>Rosalie lifted her eyes to her friend.</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent could not hear what was being
said, but he gathered from the attitude of his
sister and Mrs. Bruce and the painful crimson
of Rosalie’s face, that some arraignment was
taking place.</p>

<p>“I suppose even the best of women are cats
at heart,” he reflected; then he spoke aloud.
“Miss Vincent and I have been making discoveries.
Her father was a connection of our
family, and on the Glee Club with me at college.”</p>

<p>“Henry!” Mrs. Nixon seized the rubber
disk that hung at his vest and spoke across
it firmly. “I have just heard a man say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the geyser is beginning to play. Let us go
closer to the bank.”</p>

<p>She took her brother’s arm and led him
away. Mrs. Bruce did the same with Irving,
who exchanged one glance with Betsy over
her head as he yielded.</p>

<p>Robert followed with Miss Maynard, and
Betsy put her arm around Rosalie.</p>

<p>“Now then, that’s over,” she said.</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes were still dilated and she
did not speak.</p>

<p>Betsy gave her a gentle shake. “Brace up,
Rosalie. Don’t be such a trembling little bird.
Your soul’s your own.—Oh, my! Isn’t that
wonderful!” For the geyser now burst forth
with a rushing volume of water which rose and
arched across the river at a height of eighty feet.</p>

<p>Betsy and Rosalie hastened down the bank
beyond the crowd, where they had a full view
of the aerial waterfall sparkling in the sunshine
as it plunged foaming into the river.</p>

<p>When the exhilarating show was over,
Betsy turned to her companion.</p>

<p>“There! Ain’t that worth a good bit o’
sacrifice to see?”</p>

<p>The girl’s hands were clasped on her breast,
and her eyes shining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“You look as admirin’ as a chipmunk,”
said Betsy; and they both laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, supposing we were alone out here,
Betsy! Wouldn’t it be beautiful!” sighed the
girl.</p>

<p>“’Twould, as sure as you’re born; but we
ain’t bondholders, so we have to work our
way, both of us; and it’s worth it. That’s
what I say, and that’s what I want you to
feel.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind if no one else minded,”
said Rosalie meekly.</p>

<p>“Don’t mind, anyway,” returned Betsy
stoutly. “That’s what I was just sayin’.
Your soul’s your own—”</p>

<p>“But she spent so much money on me.”</p>

<p>“How much?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know; but if I could pay it back,
and needn’t care how her eyes look—”</p>

<p>“Very likely you will pay her some day.
Meanwhile keep a stiff upper lip. Don’t act
as if you’d done anything wrong, ’cause you
haven’t.”</p>

<p>“I’m not clever,” mourned Rosalie. “Look
at Helen Maynard. See what she has done.
She was a poor girl, too. She was older than
I, and we seldom met at school; but she studied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
practical things. I was so happy, and my teachers
so delightful, but what did it fit me for?”</p>

<p>“Nothin’, and I knew it,” responded Betsy
bluntly.</p>

<p>“It made life brighter and fuller,” said
Rosalie, and her eyes looked away to where
Betsy knew she could not follow. Her old
idea of the princess in exile returned upon her
with force as she gazed at the girl, for Rosalie
drew herself up unconsciously; leafy shadows
lay in her pensive eyes and brocaded her white
gown, while an arrow of sunlight gilded the
braided coronet of her hair.</p>

<p>“Although I went back to washing Mrs.
Pogram’s dishes, I didn’t live in that kitchen,”
she went on softly. “There were great fields—green
fields and pastures new, where my
thoughts went roving.”</p>

<p>They both kept silence for a space; then
Rosalie came back from her short day-dream
and met her friend’s eyes. “I don’t think I
have a bad disposition?” she said questioningly.</p>

<p>“I’ve never seen any signs of it,” returned
Betsy dryly.</p>

<p>“There are moments when I wish I had
borne with Loomis. One of them was when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Mr. Derwent said he had known my father;
and Mrs. Nixon looked at me from such a
lofty height!” The girl’s cheeks burned again.</p>

<p>Betsy heaved a quiet sigh. “There’s only
one thing the matter with you, Rosalie.” As
she spoke, Betsy ran her fingers down the
girl’s backbone, and the latter squirmed away.
“It’s your spine.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with it?” asked Rosalie,
startled.</p>

<p>“I don’t know; but ’tain’t stiff enough.”
Betsy smiled faintly into her companion’s
puzzled face. “Seems sort o’ tough to be born
a vine, and then not be given a thing to cling
to.” She shook her head. “You was born a
vine, Rosalie, and now that the supports have
been pulled out, you can either trail along
the ground where every passer-by is likely
to step on you, or you can reach around till
you find a new support for yourself.”</p>

<p>She paused, and Rosalie looked troubled and
thoughtful.</p>

<p>“Vines ain’t left altogether helpless,” went
on Betsy. “They’re given lots o’ tendrils, and
they lay hold o’ the queerest and most unpromising
things sometimes and begin to pull
themselves up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“But who wants to be a parasite!” exclaimed
Rosalie. “They destroy!”</p>

<p>“A wholesome vine only benefits,” answered
the other; “and it mustn’t be content with
shrinkin’ along the ground and invitin’ everybody
to step on it, and hurt it. Even a vine
has its own sort of backbone, its own power,
and it hasn’t a thing to fear. It’ll find its
place to climb if it looks up and not down.”</p>

<p>“There’s one trellis I wish I could have,”
said Rosalie wistfully, gazing at her friend,
“and its name is Betsy Foster.”</p>

<p>“Come now, Rosalie; that’s pretty hard.”
The older woman’s lips twitched. “I’ve got
some flesh on my bones.”</p>

<p>“O Betsy! Dear Betsy!” burst forth the
girl lovingly. “Clever Betsy, as Captain
Salter calls you.”</p>

<p>“You know Hiram, do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; and when I first came to
Fairport,—it was the winter before Mrs.
Bruce sent me to school,—he told me about
you, and told me you’d be there in summer
with this rich family, and that if I could get
you for a friend it would be the best thing that
could happen to me; and it has been, Betsy—except
that it did give me that bitter-sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
school experience.” The girl put her arm
around her companion. “Captain Salter told
me so much about you—how you had always
managed to do for people in the village. He
thinks you’re a wonder.”</p>

<p>Miss Foster started to speak, but changed
her mind and merely grunted. Then, after a
silent moment of endurance of the girl’s embrace,
she changed the subject.</p>

<p>“Unwind that tendril now,” she said, taking
Rosalie’s hand and moving her away; “and
be careful, child, who you do reach out to,”
she added seriously.</p>

<p>“Oh, are you going, Betsy?” exclaimed the
girl, troubled.</p>

<p>The woman hesitated. “You let me go
tell Mrs. Bruce that I’ll walk back to the
hotel so they won’t wait for me. They’re
probably all in the wagon by this time, and
wonderin’ where I am.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait right here,” returned Rosalie
eagerly, and she stood watching Betsy’s retreating
figure with wistful eyes.</p>

<p>Miss Foster presented herself in the group
who were waiting for the carriage, and announced
to Mrs. Bruce her wish to walk back
to the hotel.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“With that girl, I suppose,” said Mrs.
Bruce, scorn in her voice. “Do as you please,
Betsy. I’ve certainly had one more lesson
in letting well enough alone. It is likely she
never would have grumbled with her bread
and butter and left Mrs. Pogram, if I had not
been the means of putting ideas into her head.
I’m obliged to admit that you were right,
Betsy, when you talked to me about it a few
weeks ago.” Mrs. Bruce gave a little sigh.
“I wish I weren’t so warm-hearted and impulsive.
Doesn’t it lead one into lots of
trouble, Mrs. Nixon?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon was of the opinion that it did;
and she still held by the arm a victim of misguided
emotion. Irving and Robert had disappeared.</p>

<p>“Come home in the carriage with us,
Henry,” she said to her captive. “There will
be a vacant place now.”</p>

<p>There was still wandering upon the river
bank among the overhanging trees a golden-haired
dryad, whose presence caused the lady
to desire the sanctuary of the park wagon for
her brother until she could have a few words
with him in private.</p>

<p>This she accomplished after they reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the hotel and she had lured him out upon the
large upper veranda, where reclining chairs invited
wanderers to repose in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent recognized the symptoms of
extreme solicitude for his comfort, and smiles
which were like flashes of heat-lightning. His
sister was a woman of much poise, and heat-lightning
seldom portends showers; still they
had been known to arrive before the atmosphere
could clear, and he had the ordinary
masculine dread of them.</p>

<p>After accepting the chair beside his sister
which she offered to him, he leaned back with
every evidence of comfort, and his first words
adroitly changed her aggression to defense.</p>

<p>“You take trifles far too seriously, Marion,”
he observed.</p>

<p>She stared, and he smilingly offered her the
rubber disk.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you do.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon compressed her lips.</p>

<p>“You misunderstand entirely,” she said at
last. “I took a very great fancy to that young
girl.”</p>

<p>“It does you credit, Marion.”</p>

<p>“And you’ve spoiled everything,” she retorted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
“I was going to arrange to have her
come to us in Boston.”</p>

<p>“In what capacity?”</p>

<p>“Waitress, of course. And now you’ve made
it impossible.”</p>

<p>“It always would have been impossible. I
couldn’t think of allowing Gorham Vincent’s
daughter to wait on our table. I highly approve
of having her come to us, however,—the
charming creature.”</p>

<p>“What are you thinking of?”</p>

<p>“Why, it seems she has no one belonging to
her.”</p>

<p>“Henry!” said Mrs. Nixon sonorously,
“the home circle is sacred.”</p>

<p>She was greatly startled; and she looked at
the insouciant face and figure of her brother
with repressed exasperation.</p>

<p>“It is a small circle in our case, certainly.”</p>

<p>“Now that Robert is at home, we shall be
three,” returned the lady.</p>

<p>It was her house, and her home circle; and
even though her wealthy bachelor brother was
its most valuable asset, she did not intend to
cede her rights.</p>

<p>There was a space of silence; then she spoke
accusingly again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have been thinking the last week, Henry,
that perhaps in bringing your stenographer
on this trip, and making her of use to me also,
you have had it in mind to suggest, on our
return, that <i>she</i> remain with us.”</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent’s eyes were fixed on the landscape.
He did not respond at once, and Mrs.
Nixon, looking at him sharply, was in doubt
whether to interpret his silence as a guilty one.</p>

<p>“Marion,” he said at last, “do you often
think of Alan?”</p>

<p>“Why—” Mrs. Nixon paused in her surprise
at this irrelevancy,—“why, yes, I do.”
It was with an effort that her thought unclasped
itself from the present, to revert to
the unfortunate one of the family: the brother
whose every effort to succeed in life had seemed
to be thwarted; whose children had died, and
whose own life had suddenly and unexpectedly
closed before he had arrived at middle age.</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent’s lips compressed under his
white mustache, and his nostrils dilated.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon observed the change in his face
with some dismay. She could not remember
when she had last heard him refer to their sorrow.
For the first time she realized that this
was perhaps because it had gone too deep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>He still kept his gaze ahead as he continued,
in detached sentences: “I never sympathized
enough with Alan. I let him fight alone too
long. I criticised when I should have carried
him. There is no torture like that unavailing
regret. Yesterday is dead, and repining is
weakness. The only atonement I can make is
to look on each individual need that presents
itself before me, and ask myself what I would
do now if that need was Alan’s.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon was silent; her folded hands
tightened. She was beholding an unsuspected
wound, hidden always beneath her brother’s
imperturbable exterior; and the apparition
held her tongue-tied.</p>

<p>They both kept silence while the shadow
crept along the veranda rail. At last Mr. Derwent
spoke again in his ordinary manner, and
with deliberation.</p>

<p>“I have had some such thought as you suspect
concerning Helen Maynard.”</p>

<p>“Is the girl friendless? Where has she been
living?” returned Mrs. Nixon defensively,
conscious that when this subdued moment had
passed, she should find a hundred embarrassments
in the prospect of housing her brother’s
stenographer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“She has been living in a boarding-house.
She has grandparents on a farm in the country.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon maintained an ominous silence.
Her brother changed his position, and an odd
look of amusement grew in his averted eyes.</p>

<p>“I have made up my mind to tell you what
has been a secret up to now, Marion.”</p>

<p>This quiet sentence sent a stream of color
over his companion’s face; evidence of a shock
that sent a wild throng of thoughts careering
through her brain.</p>

<p>Horrors! What was coming now? Her
brother, whose fortune, as everybody knew,
was to go to Robert; her brother, whose affliction
made him averse to society! Could such
a thing be as that this very narrowing of his
social life had thrown him back on the society
and sympathy of the neat, well-groomed girl,
who was his right hand at the office.</p>

<p>Why, of course! and Mrs. Nixon called herself
imbecile for never having feared it. She
reproached herself wildly for not having provided
better for his recreation. More card-parties,
more reading aloud; more sympathy
in the travel-lectures he enjoyed. Oh, fool
that she had been! Probably he had escorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Miss Maynard to those very lectures, and she
had elucidated the pictures.</p>

<p>It took but a moment of time for all these
considerations to tear across Mrs. Nixon’s
mind, and he added:—</p>

<p>“I think it is time now to speak of it.”</p>

<p>With haunting visions of card-games never
played, she responded unsteadily:—</p>

<p>“Pray do.”</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent pressed his finger-tips lightly
together.</p>

<p>“Before I engaged Helen,” he began, “she
had engaged me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon leaned back in her chair under
pressure of faintness.</p>

<p>“Her grandparents came to me as a well-known
lawyer and engaged me to undertake
her cause in a lawsuit regarding a large fortune.
I have been working on it for a long
time, and success is in sight. The girl was
being sensibly educated, and so at last it came
about that I took her into the office for the
convenience of us both.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon’s face was a study; but her
mind was not yet relieved.</p>

<p>“Miss Maynard is an heiress?” she asked.</p>

<p>“There is no doubt of it now. The red tape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
has been all measured off, and only a few matters
of form are left before she comes into her
own.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon sat in silence for a time.</p>

<p>“You know her so much better than I do,
Henry,” she said at last, tentatively.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Mr. Derwent gave a quiet exclamation.
“She is an excellent piece of mechanism.
Her mind is as well ordered as her toilet. Not
a hair out of place.”</p>

<p>The speaker’s manner and tone reassured
his sister so far that she could give her thought
to consideration of the girl in this new light,
and to wondering what impression her own
treatment had made upon her. Miss Maynard’s
opinion would now be of importance.
Mrs. Nixon was grateful that <i>noblesse oblige</i>,
and that she could never be less than courteous
to an inferior; a great convenience when one
considers that an inferior sometimes surprises
with as sudden a rise into prominence as is
accomplished by a jack-in-the-box.</p>

<p>“And your idea, Henry—” she asked again.</p>

<p>“Was simply,” he answered, “that in her
changed circumstances Helen will require the
guidance of some older woman. There will be
no ‘back to the farm’ for her, and I suspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
that the old people will not wish to change
their manner of living.”</p>

<p>“Will she have very much?”</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent nodded. “Enough to make
me glad her head is so level.”</p>

<p>“She must be exceedingly attached and
very grateful to you,” said Mrs. Nixon, after
a thoughtful pause, during which she tried to
remember just how repressive her manner
had been to her quiet companion.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t need to be grateful. She pays
me. Helen is not impulsive.”</p>

<p>“You mean she has a cold nature,” returned
Mrs. Nixon. “I do think, Henry, you might
have told me all this when we started out on
this trip.”</p>

<p>He shook his head. “It is because of a forwarded
telegram which I received here this
noon that I tell you now.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon thought again.</p>

<p>“And you would like her to live with us,”
she said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I only suggest it. I thought if you liked her—but
Helen may have other views.”</p>

<p>“I see,” returned Mrs. Nixon slowly, “I
see.” And she rocked in her chair with reflections
wherein her lost waitress was forgotten.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>THE FAITHFUL GEYSER</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">While</span> this conversation was going on, Mrs.
Bruce was sitting on the veranda below, waiting
for Irving. He had promised to meet her
in time for the next performance of the Old
Faithful Geyser.</p>

<p>While she sat there she observed Betsy and
Rosalie returning to the hotel, and her eyes
narrowed as she regarded the girl’s tall slender
figure and free carriage.</p>

<p>“It is no wonder I was attracted,” she
thought; and now that the case had come
before her again, and she had time to consider
that her beneficiary had inflicted upon her a
disappointment, Rosalie’s proved incapacity
took on the proportions of ingratitude. With
Mrs. Bruce, even to suspect that her will was
being thwarted was misery, and her gaze
rested coldly on the girl now. At the same
moment Irving and Robert came in sight; and
Mrs. Bruce resented the fact that they hastened
to approach Betsy, as she paused to say
good-by to her companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>The four stood a moment talking, and as
Rosalie withdrew from the group Mrs. Bruce
watched Irving follow her a few steps and then
lift his hat as the girl shook her head and hurried
away.</p>

<p>Robert, whistling loudly, ran up the steps
of the hotel, and Mrs. Bruce scarcely nodded
in response to his cheerful greeting as he went
into the house.</p>

<p>She rose from her chair. “See the people
going out there,” she said to Irving, as he and
Betsy approached. “I thought you would
never come!”</p>

<p>“Five minutes’ grace, Madama,” said Irving,
looking at his watch. “Don’t get nervous.”
Betsy started to go into the house. Irving
caught her by the arm. “Not a bit of it,” he
added. “You’re going with us.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Irving. I meant to go
out later,” returned Betsy, always conscious
of “acquiring merit” by leaving these two
by themselves.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t trust you—I wouldn’t trust
you around the corner,” returned Irving; and
he kept his hold on the sleeve of Betsy’s brown
silk shirt-waist, so the three moved together
out to the point of interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>The Old Faithful has been talked about,
written about, and visited so much and so
long, that there remains nothing fresh to be
said; but it is like any other classic,—perennial,
exhilarating, and satisfying.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce, despite the fly in her amber,
approached the mound of geyserite with
lively anticipation, and watched with absorption
the first spasmodic spurts that were flung
from the crater’s mouth.</p>

<p>Later, when the splendid volume of hot
water sprang skyward, she and Betsy both
forgot that there was a bone of contention
between them. For minutes the rushing giant
fountain, falling in a cloud of foam and spray,
held itself against the azure sky; then, like
a beautiful captive returning to its dungeon,
fell back lower and lower, till only its tears
coursed down the terraces they had formed,
and lay in shallow basins, whose lovely tints
they did not conceal.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce, feeling that she could suggest
nothing that would improve this glorious
ebullition, confined herself to exclamations.</p>

<p>“What a blessing there is a moon!” she said,
as they turned back toward the hotel. “I can
hardly wait for to-night. Where do you suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the Nixons are? and that poor little Miss
Maynard? If Mr. Derwent is making her
write his letters instead of coming out here, I
think it’s a perfect shame.”</p>

<p>“Sh! sh! Madama,” said Irving. “Let
everybody be innocent until he’s proved
guilty. Go into the house now and lie down,
and let the world go wrong for a little while.”</p>

<p>“I can’t quite make Miss Maynard out,
Irving. I tried to talk with her a number of
times on our drive this afternoon, because I
must say Mrs. Nixon is so very quiet I feel
sorry for the girl; but she always was abstracted,
and every time I spoke to her she
seemed to have to bring her thoughts back
from somewhere.”</p>

<p>“From <i>him</i>, perhaps,” suggested Irving.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps so. I never thought of that.”
Mrs. Bruce shook her head. “Deliver me from
sightseeing with a girl who is in love!”</p>

<p>Irving smiled. “I know I’m never coming
to a place like this unless <i>she</i> is here, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Irving, don’t! That awful time will
have to come, I suppose, but don’t ruin this
lucid interval by talking about it.”</p>

<p>The young man seldom indulged in any
covert interchange with Betsy, but now his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
eyes sparkled with fun as he caught his old
friend’s eye.</p>

<p>“Such a mother-in-law as you will make,
Madama!” he exclaimed devoutly.</p>

<p>“That depends,” returned Mrs. Bruce complacently.
“If you let me pass upon the girl
before you commit yourself, I shall do my
best.”</p>

<p>“What pretty hair you must have had when
you were twenty,” said Irving irrelevantly,
after a pause, regarding the fair head at his
shoulder, for Mrs. Bruce was carrying her hat
in her hand.</p>

<p>“I don’t care for that left-handed compliment
at all,” she replied with spirit. “It’s
pretty now.”</p>

<p>“It is, for a fact; but wasn’t it still lighter,
more golden, when you were twenty?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was perfectly lovely,” she returned.
“The years play us all sorts of mean tricks,
but one of the meanest is darkening one’s hair.
It was lovely at the time I was married; but
at that time I suppose you didn’t care whether
I wore hair or corn-silk!”</p>

<p>“Corn-silk,” repeated Irving abstractedly.
“That’s what it’s like. Corn-silk.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t, you flatterer,” returned Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Bruce, with a little conscious laugh; and she
gave a triumphant side-glance at Betsy, who
kept eyes ahead, fearing every moment that
her mistress’s complaisance would receive a
shock in the comprehension of Irving’s drift.</p>

<p>He understood the meaning of a swift
glance suddenly sent him by Miss Foster, and
began to whistle, softly.</p>

<p>As they neared the hotel he spoke. “Come
to my room for a minute, Betsy, please. I
need some sewing up, and I’ll give it to you
so you can take it over and sit by Mrs. Bruce
to see that she obeys my order to take a nap.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce regarded him affectionately and
went with docility to the greenwood of her bedroom;
and Betsy, with no change of feature,
followed Irving to his. When they were inside,
he closed the door, seated Betsy in a green
rocker, and put himself astride a straight chair.</p>

<p>“You know very well,” said Betsy uneasily,
“that if I stay, Mrs. Bruce will come over
here.”</p>

<p>“No, she won’t,” returned Irving, “for the
best of reasons. She doesn’t know which
room I have.”</p>

<p>“Well, give me your things quick,” said
Betsy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why are you afraid, all of a sudden?”</p>

<p>“I—” returned Betsy, hesitating, “I want
to—to keep her happy.”</p>

<p>“Not for your own sake, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>“No. Give me your things, Mr. Irving.”</p>

<p>The young man did not move. “Betsy,”
he said, “she <i>mustn’t</i> stay here.”</p>

<p>“Who mustn’t stay where?” she returned,
reddening.</p>

<p>“You heard Mr. Derwent say that they
were related,” went on Irving.</p>

<p>“You think,” said Betsy, with rare sarcasm,
“she’d be in better business writin’ stories for
some fireside paper, or imposin’ on folks’
credulity?”</p>

<p>Her companion magnanimously overlooked
the thrust.</p>

<p>“She’s too fine from head to foot, physically,
and too fine in her innocence, to be
touched with anything rough. She mustn’t
stay here.”</p>

<p>“Who’s to prevent it?” asked Betsy quietly,
though Irving was unconsciously rewarding
her for much of her devotion.</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“That ain’t possible.”</p>

<p>“Not only possible, but easy. Give her the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
money to go back to Portland to stay till we
come. She’ll never know it’s mine.”</p>

<p>“No, sir! I won’t do that. She’d never take
so much money as that from me, and I’d have
to tell her the truth. She’s just possessed to
pay Mrs. Bruce back, as it is. She’d rather
work in their Park years than not do it.”</p>

<p>Irving made an impatient sound, and Betsy
shook her head.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bruce is awful down on her. You’ll
find it out if you touch the subject any lower’n
her hair. I know the symptoms.”</p>

<p>“Well, what are you going to do, then?”
asked Irving, frowning impatiently.</p>

<p>Miss Foster looked back at him, full.</p>

<p>“That ain’t anything to any young man,”
she said impressively.</p>

<p>“You’re going to do something, then?” he
asked eagerly. “I don’t want to go into that
dining-room to-night. Do you like to see her
there?”</p>

<p>He rose, spurned his chair, and walked up
and down the log cage.</p>

<p>Betsy followed him with her eyes. “Look
here, Mr. Irving. I love Rosalie Vincent.”</p>

<p>The pedestrian stopped, and hugged the
speaker’s thin shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I don’t want to have any feelin’
stirred up against her. If you take any interest
in her, just follow my advice, and while
we’re all together here, don’t notice her, and,
above all, don’t speak about her.”</p>

<p>“She’s like the bit of porcelain going down
the river among the earthen jugs,” burst forth
Irving.</p>

<p>“Then don’t throw a rock at her,” returned
Betsy. “She’s got a ticklish enough time without
that. Where are your things, Mr. Irving?”
Betsy started from her chair in a sudden
panic.</p>

<p>“Then have you any plan, Clever Betsy?”
he persisted. “’Tisn’t enough just to be fond
of her and—and <i>mope</i>.”</p>

<p>“You sassy boy!” exclaimed Betsy, concealing
her inward exultation that Rosalie
had a friend at court, albeit a dangerous one.
“You mind your business and I’ll mind mine;
and it wasn’t ever to mope.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, you old dear! I know you’ll
do something for that—that wood-nymph.”</p>

<p>“Irving Bruce, give me your mendin’. Do
you suppose there’ll be any naps till I get
back?”</p>

<p>“Tell her I had to hunt for it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“I won’t lie for you or anybody else.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have you. It’s the absolute
truth.” The speaker strode over to where his
suit-case lay open on the floor.</p>

<p>Rummaging through its contents, he fished
out a white silk negligée shirt and quickly
tore it down the back.</p>

<p>Betsy sprang forward and cried out, but
the deed was done. He pressed the garment
into her arms and opened the door.</p>

<p>“That was <i>sinful</i>!” she exclaimed, regarding
the rent.</p>

<p>“Not half so bad as hurting your immortal
soul?” He laughed at her long face and pushed
her gently out the door. “Remember now,”
threateningly, “if you don’t do something,
I will. I’m trusting you, Betsy.”</p>

<p>“That’s wicked. That’s just wicked,” said
Miss Foster to herself, holding up to view the
fine garment as she moved down the deserted
hall.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>THE HEIRESS</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Robert Nixon ran whistling into the
hotel and took the stairs two at a time up to
his room, he met his mother just coming in
from the upper veranda, where she had had
the interview with her brother.</p>

<p>“I want to see you, Robert,” she said, so
solemnly that he looked amused.</p>

<p>“Your tone takes me back to childhood’s
unhappy hour,” he returned. “Which is it
to be, a spanking or the closet?”</p>

<p>“Come into my room a minute,” went on
Mrs. Nixon.</p>

<p>“I do believe it’s the spanking. Say,
mamma, forget it. The geyser’s just going to
spout.”</p>

<p>“I must speak to you first.”</p>

<p>“’Tisn’t fair,” objected the youth, “because
you do spout more than once an hour,
you know.” But he followed his stately
mother into her room, for she looked more
imposing than usual, and his curiosity was
roused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as she had closed the door she
turned to him.</p>

<p>“Where is Miss Maynard?” she asked.</p>

<p>Her son’s eyebrows and shoulders both
jerked upwards.</p>

<p>“You can search <i>me</i>,” he responded.</p>

<p>“Sit down, Robert.”</p>

<p>He obeyed the impressive order, and his
mother seated herself opposite.</p>

<p>“What has that sleek, quiet little mouse
been doing?” he asked. “I haven’t seen her
since we left the Riverside.”</p>

<p>“Robert, I want you to <i>think</i>, and I want
you to be serious.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best, but I’m rusty in both
lines.”</p>

<p>“I want you to tell me how my treatment
of Miss Maynard has impressed you.”</p>

<p>Robert whistled softly. “Offended, is she?
Well, she ought to know that you’re never
effusive. I’ve tried to flirt with her a bit, and
strike an average.”</p>

<p>“Strike an average, Robert?” Mrs. Nixon
spoke anxiously. “Tell me directly what you
mean. Did my behavior make you feel that
to be necessary?”</p>

<p>“Well,” the son puffed out his lips, “what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
with Uncle Henry’s deafness, and your Vere-de-Vere
repose, it has seemed to me at times
that it was rather dull for a maiden stowed
there in the stage beside you. I made a few
essays, as I say, to jolly her, but—well, I
can’t say they were successful. One doesn’t
care to have one’s sweet and cheery conversation
treated like the tunefulness of a string
of sleigh-bells. Miss Maynard invariably
makes me feel the drifting snow when I try
to chirk her up.”</p>

<p>“She’ll be a success then,” responded Mrs.
Nixon, with conviction; and while her son
stared at this comment, she went on: “I am
glad of all the civility you have shown her,
Robert. It is not natural to me, as you say,
to be talkative or—or gushing, and yet I’ve
always been perfectly civil to Miss Maynard.
I’m sure of that. You never noticed anything
else, did you?”</p>

<p>Robert looked as he felt, increasingly puzzled.</p>

<p>“No, mother. What’s up? Has Miss Maynard
been complaining to Uncle Henry?”</p>

<p>“No. <i>I</i> complain of your Uncle Henry that
he has not been frank with me. When he
suggested the convenience to him of taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
his stenographer on this trip, and said she
could hook my gowns, he should have told
me that the very presentable, quiet girl I had
so often seen in his office was a probable heiress.”</p>

<p>“What?” Robert sat up and his voice broke
into the high register. “You don’t say so! I
don’t blame him. There’s too many a slip
about that sort of possibility.”</p>

<p>“It’s settled,” said Mrs. Nixon solemnly.
“It was settled to-day. She <i>is</i> one; and from
what your uncle says, the fortune is large.”</p>

<p>Robert clasped his hands and lifted his
eyes. “I’ve always admired her nose. How
much straighter it will be now!” he ejaculated
devoutly.</p>

<p>“I insist, Robert,” said Mrs. Nixon, “I
must insist for once on your being serious.
I’m very much pleased with you, and with
what you tell me, because— Well, my son,
I do not need to remind you that a vulgar
person with money is a creature of no interest
to me; but Miss Maynard is a lady. I have
always granted it; and now she will need advice
and directing. Her relatives live in the
country, and are too elderly to be available
in any case. I should wish her to feel that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
might turn to me; and I hope nothing in my
behavior on this trip has had a—a tendency
to estrange her.”</p>

<p>“Your conduct has been to a stranger,”
returned Robert.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon lifted her head with a regal air
in which there was nevertheless anxiety.</p>

<p>“I suppose for the sake of making a foolish
pun you would say that, and make me uncomfortable.”</p>

<p>Her son laughed, and going over to where
she sat, put his arms around her unyielding
form.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, mother. You may be a bit
cool in your methods, but you arrive, just
like a fireless cooker. How long has the heiress
known of her good fortune?”</p>

<p>“Just to-day. Just since noon.”</p>

<p>“Noon, eh? Did you see me escorting her
at the Riverside show?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Mrs. Nixon lugubriously.
“I was too much engaged in taking care of
your Uncle Henry.”</p>

<p>Robert straightened up and threw his head
back for a hearty laugh.</p>

<p>“The Yellowstone is growing exciting,” he
said. “Heavers to right of us, heiresses to left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of us. Wayward brothers, and,” striking his
breast triumphantly, “wise sons!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Robert. You’ve done very well, I
must say.”</p>

<p>“Miss Maynard,—you observe that I
speak the name with new and due reverence,—the
heiress, I say, went to school with Hebe
the heaver.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” returned Mrs. Nixon
coldly. “Did—did the waitress claim acquaintance?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” rejoined Robert cheerfully.
“Cousin turned the heiress down.”</p>

<p>“Robert, what <i>are</i> you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Why, you heard Uncle Henry say we were
related.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon made an exclamation. “Why
must men of all ages lose their wits at sight
of a pretty face?” she inquired of the ceiling.</p>

<p>“The conundrum of the ages, mamma, and
I’m young yet, so I can’t tell you; but if you
hadn’t been more of a sister than a mother
you’d have watched my foresighted behavior.
To tell the truth, when you glared at Hebe
there by the river, I thought she was going to
cry; so when Brute’s mother buttonholed him
and you took Uncle Henry by the ear, I sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
refuge with the stenographer, though the
heaver looked pretty enough to eat. I knew
Betsy would look after her.”</p>

<p>“They were at school together?” repeated
Mrs. Nixon, wondering.</p>

<p>“Sure as you’re a foot high; and when the
now valuable Miss Maynard accosted Hebe
at the Fountain House, the lovely heaver
begged her to forget it. There’s a story attached
to her. Brute told me—”</p>

<p>“Yes,” interrupted Mrs. Nixon impatiently.
“Mrs. Bruce told me what she had done for
her. I dare say she has found her right place.
There is no need of making a fuss over her.”</p>

<p>Robert shook his finger at the speaker.
“Careful, careful, mother. Supposing you
should waken to-morrow morning and find
that the heaver’s uncle in India had passed to
his fathers, and that Miss Vincent was likely
to require the advice of an experienced chaperon.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon waved this nonsense aside with
a gesture, and returned to the subject in hand.</p>

<p>“I think the thing for me to do is to find
Miss Maynard now, tell her that Mr. Derwent
has informed me of her good fortune, and congratulate
her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert rubbed his hands together with a
malevolent and gleeful laugh. “Can’t you
hide me behind the screen and send for her?”
he begged.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon had risen and now drew herself
up.</p>

<p>“What, pray, do you think would be so
amusing about it? Do you think your mother
would be less than dignified?”</p>

<p>“No, no, honey,” rejoined her irreverent
son, forcibly taking her reluctant hands. “I
was only thinking of witnessing a friendly interview
between an icicle and a stalactite.” He
chuckled again and clapped the maternal hands
together, totally against the maternal will.</p>

<p>“You may go now, Robert, and—and, go
on as you have begun.” She pushed him
toward the door. “You say the geyser is playing?”</p>

<p>“Was playing.”</p>

<p>“Well, we must all see it the next time.
Good-by, dear.”</p>

<p>Closing the door behind him, the lady returned
to her mirror and gave her hair some
touches.</p>

<p>Then she started again to the door with intent
to seek her “companion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>As she reached it, she was met by a knock.</p>

<p>She opened and came face to face with the
object of her thoughts.</p>

<p>“Come in, come in, Miss Maynard,” she
said, and there was a noticeable cordiality in
her voice.</p>

<p>The trim girl, with her symmetrical little
face and smooth brown hair, stepped just inside
the door.</p>

<p>“I came to see if you wished to change your
gown before tea.”</p>

<p>“I am not going to change it to-day. Come
in. I wished to see you. Mr. Derwent has been
telling me of your good fortune. I wish to congratulate
you.”</p>

<p>There was no elation or change of manner
in the quiet girl as she replied:—</p>

<p>“Thank you. Mr. Derwent has done fine
work for me. You don’t wish my help, then?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon hesitated. She knew that yesterday
she would have said no, and closed the
door, and she knew that Helen Maynard
knew it; so though she desired to beg her to
be seated for a chat, she indulged in no such
stupidity.</p>

<p>“Did you see the geyser play?” she asked.
“The Old Faithful?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“No.” Helen Maynard had indeed been
in her own room, careless of scenery, absorbed
in the considerations that had held her captive
since Mr. Derwent had shown his telegram.</p>

<p>“My son says it has just played. Let us not
miss the next show.”</p>

<p>“Do you wish me to come for you?”</p>

<p>The question was put in precisely the same
tone and manner that Helen would have used
yesterday, and Mrs. Nixon admired her poise.</p>

<p>“Thank you. I am going down into the
office. I shall be glad to see the geyser with
you when the time comes.”</p>

<p>Helen Maynard turned away, and a cynical
little smile grew on her lips. Mrs. Nixon had
tried nobly to keep her usual manner unchanged;
but despite herself there was a
warmth there unknown before, and Helen
was alert to perceive it.</p>

<p>The girl hummed an air from “Faust” as
she ran down the stairs of the gigantic log-cabin.
It was the “Calf of Gold” that she
sang.</p>

<p>She was, as Mr. Derwent had said, a very
level-headed young woman, and under the
present circumstances kept her joyous excitement
under control; but she was alive in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
fibre to the change in her life which these six
figures to her credit were about to make.</p>

<p>She had faced all that failure would mean;
faced the prospect of a narrow life on the farm,
or a struggling life in the city. In either case
a life of early-to-bed and early-to-rise routine,
against which all her tastes rebelled.</p>

<p>With the relaxation from strain had come
a certain intoxication; but pride kept the girl
externally calm. The patronizing Mrs. Bruce
would scrutinize her now through those eye-glasses.
She should never have a chance to
say, “Set a beggar on horseback!” Irving
Bruce would, perhaps, become aware of her
existence. She exulted in the steadiness with
which she had held Robert Nixon at a distance
with his amiable raillery. She had done
this from politic motives, knowing that if she
were to remain in Mrs. Nixon’s good graces,
only so could it be accomplished; but now it
increased her satisfaction in the consideration
of the subtle change in that lady’s manner
toward her.</p>

<p>What a gulf now between herself and her
acquaintance of Lambeth days! Mr. Derwent’s
interest in Rosalie had merely served
to get her into trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Years ago on the farm Miss Maynard’s
grandmother had said to her husband:—</p>

<p>“Helen’s dreadfully high-headed. I don’t
know whatever’ll become of her if she gets
all that money.”</p>

<p>More than a slight mixture of contempt
pervaded her thoughts of Rosalie now. No
combination of circumstances would ever have
forced <i>her</i> to wait on tourists in the Yellowstone.
It did not raise the poor young waitress
in Miss Maynard’s regard that Mr. Derwent
had been attracted by her, and even claimed
relationship. In that particular she shared
Mrs. Nixon’s annoyance. Helen thought she
might herself do something for Rosalie some
day if the girl were really helpless, or had some
sad reason for not desiring recognition.</p>

<p>In a few short hours Miss Maynard had
floated up from the stratum occupied by the
under-dog to the vantage-ground of the powerful,
and her heart exulted.</p>

<p>As soon as she saw the Bruces she knew that
they had heard the news. Mrs. Bruce approached
her with an alert manner.</p>

<p>“I’m delighted to hear of your good fortune,
Miss Maynard,” she said briskly; and
Helen thanked her demurely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you hurry back to Boston?” added the
lady.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” returned Helen quietly. “Mr.
Derwent needs his stenographer as much as
ever. I am not his only client.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not. Ha, ha, pretty good! Well,
my dear Miss Maynard, I wish you all prosperity.
I’ve always been attracted to you.”</p>

<p>“I do think, Irving,” said Mrs. Bruce to
her son as they sat at supper, “it’s the strangest
thing in the world to see so young a person
absolutely stoical at such a time. If it had
happened to me at her age I should have
called upon everybody to rejoice with me!”</p>

<p>“Probably she is to the manner born,” returned
Irving absent-mindedly. His thoughts
were with the fair-haired girl whose round
slender arms were bearing a tray across the
dining-room.</p>

<p>“That is no work for Miss Vincent,” he
observed tentatively.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we know,” returned Mrs.
Bruce coolly.</p>

<p>“You said once,” remarked Betsy quietly,
“that Rosalie was an artist; that you always
knew ’em when you saw ’em. It does seem
queer work for an artist.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce stared at her companion in surprise.</p>

<p>“Well, whose fault is it, I should like to
know. She did have some talent. I tried to
have it cultivated, but evidently she was too
superficial. People find their level. You can’t
help it.”</p>

<p>Betsy gave Irving such a repressive look
that he swallowed some remark which had
reached the end of his tongue. Then, again
opening his lips, he gave Mrs. Bruce a <i>résumé</i>
of what had happened to her protégée since
her befriending of the girl.</p>

<p>“Well, why shouldn’t she have married
Mrs. Pogram’s brother?” she returned carelessly.</p>

<p>“He is a cad, I tell you,” returned Irving,
manfully repressing his rising wrath.</p>

<p>“Well,” Mrs. Bruce shrugged her shoulders,
“the girl is a beggar. She can’t choose.”</p>

<p>The light that suddenly sparkled in Irving’s
eyes made Betsy hasten to speak.</p>

<p>“You said when we were talkin’ about it
that time, that it was a pity for girls who had
those talents to get married. I guess Rosalie
feels herself she has some talent.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Mrs. Bruce, busily eating,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and unconscious of the storm brewing beside
her, “a talent for,” she laughed,—“heaving.
She’s just a pretty doll, and it is amazing what
fools a pretty face will make of men of all
types and ages.” Mrs. Bruce laughed gleefully.
“I shan’t forget Mrs. Nixon’s eyes when
she saw her brother sitting on the grass and
apparently making love to the girl. Now, take
Miss Maynard, there’s strength and poise in
the very lift of her head.” Mrs. Bruce looked
across at the Nixon table approvingly. “I do
hope, Irving, you will take a little pains to
become acquainted with Miss Maynard. I
understand the girl’s reserve now and her abstraction.
I asked Robert if he and his mother
had known about it, and he said they had not;
but I’m not so sure about <i>him</i>;”—the speaker
shook her head astutely;—“he has been very
civil to the girl ever since we started.”</p>

<p>“Heavens! is that a sign?” exclaimed Irving
testily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce looked around at him and raised
her eyebrows. “Why not, cross-patch? He
is his mother’s son, and she has nearly refrigerated
her poor companion. I’ve been quite
nice to her.” Mrs. Bruce returned to her
omelet complacently. “It will make things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
pleasant now. Everybody is looking forward
so to seeing the colored lights thrown on the
geyser to-night. I think it would be nice of
you, Irving, to take Miss Maynard out to see
it. There’s a moon, too.”</p>

<p>“It would be very nice of me,” returned the
young man savagely. “Colored lights on the
geyser! I wonder if they paint lilies out here!”</p>

<p>He pushed his chair back from the table.
“Will you and Betsy excuse me, Madama;”
and without further apology Irving left the
table and went out to the office, where on four
sides of the great chimney were blazing generous
open fires, that could roast an ox.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce turned to her companion.</p>

<p>“What has put Mr. Irving out of sorts?”
she asked.</p>

<p>Betsy ate very busily. “’Tain’t best to notice
his moods, Mrs. Bruce. You know that
was always the best way to treat him.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce looked across again at the Nixon
table and laughed maliciously. “This isn’t
Mrs. Nixon’s lucky day,” she said. “First her
brother has to be lured from a siren, and then
she has the shock of discovering that she has
been entertaining an heiress unawares! Poor
Mrs. Nixon! It will be sport to watch her now.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>THE LOOKOUT</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the comings and goings through the halls
and veranda of the charming inn, Irving Bruce
managed to lose his stepmother and find Betsy
Foster, greatly to the latter’s confusion; for
it was time for the evening performance of the
geyser.</p>

<p>Irving took his old friend by the arm.
“You’re going out there with me, Betsy,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Not without Mrs. Bruce, I ain’t.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are. We’re going to stray in the
moonlight together.”</p>

<p>“If you ever had another guess comin’
you’ve got it now, Mr. Irving,” declared Betsy
firmly. “You find Mrs. Bruce right off.”</p>

<p>Irving sighed and succumbed. Finding his
adorer was an easy matter, and he did so without
more ado. They joined the throng that
moved toward the geyser, and as good fortune
would have it, were in time to find one seat
on the benches where Mrs. Bruce and Mrs.
Nixon could sit together. Then Irving unostentatiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
withdrew, and again catching
Betsy by the arm took her a few paces away.
The silvery light of the clear moon bathed the
cool mountain night.</p>

<p>“What have you decided to do, Betsy?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean Rosalie.”</p>

<p>Irving gave the thin arm an impatient shake.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Betsy coolly, “I haven’t decided.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t do something, I shall.”</p>

<p>“You ain’t qualified,” remarked Betsy
curtly.</p>

<p>“Are you?” retorted her companion. “That
thing mustn’t be allowed to go on. That
waitress business! That lovely flower subjected
to orders and winks and tips. I won’t
stand it.”</p>

<p>“Well now, you can’t do a thing!” declared
Betsy firmly.</p>

<p>“Are you going to?”</p>

<p>“I am, in my own time and way.”</p>

<p>“Does your own time and way include letting
Rosalie work the rest of the season?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Betsy tersely. “You mustn’t
interfere, Mr. Irving. You’ll only do
harm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Irving gave an exclamation. “There is one
thing I can do: go away to-morrow. I’m not
going to stay here and watch it.”</p>

<p>“But Mrs. Bruce—” began Betsy, troubled.</p>

<p>“Can do as she pleases,” put in Irving.
“I’ll go to Yellowstone Lake and fish till she
gets ready to follow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh! Mr. Irving!”</p>

<p>The exclamation was of joy, for in the earnestness
of their talk Betsy had not noticed
the preliminary spurts of water, and now the
splendid captive stream burst its bonds and
gushed skyward in the moonlight. Its banners
of spray hung and floated cloud-like in
the breeze; and while they gazed, all at once
the pure white flushed to rose, then changed
to violet, and presently a gauzy rainbow hung
between earth and heaven, a thing of supernatural
beauty.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose <i>she</i> is seeing this?” murmured
Irving.</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of it,” Betsy replied promptly.
She feared that any other answer would send
her companion to the commissary department
of the inn.</p>

<p>Helen Maynard and Mr. Derwent were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
together watching the lovely sight when Robert
Nixon came upon them. His hands were in
his pockets and he was whistling softly, as was
his wont when the performance was not cheerfully
piercing.</p>

<p>“May I come and stand by the rich lady?”
he asked.</p>

<p>The geyser was just disappearing.</p>

<p>“How cold and blank the night seems to
have turned!” said Helen pensively.</p>

<p>Robert struck his breast with his doubled
fist.</p>

<p>“Cruel maiden!” he ejaculated, “why flout
me thus? Say, Miss Maynard,” he continued,
in a voice changed to interest, “do you know
you can make Uncle Henry hear better than
anybody?”</p>

<p>“I have made a study of it,” returned the
girl composedly.</p>

<p>Robert gazed at her admiringly. “I think
it was downright fine and heroic for Uncle
Henry to crush those conspirators and get
your shekels for you. He’s going to miss you
like his right hand.”</p>

<p>“I hope he will miss me a little.” As she
spoke Helen looked up at the fine head set
so well on Mr. Derwent’s broad shoulders;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
at the white mustache, and gray hair, and all
the features she knew so well.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet she admires him,” thought Robert,
following her gaze to the impassive face.
“He’s a winner. If he only had his hearing
he’d make us all take notice.”</p>

<p>Robert shook his head with the fleeting
sympathy of prosperous youth.</p>

<p>The sightseers began to gravitate toward
the hotel, and this trio moved with them.</p>

<p>Within the inn all was warmth and light.
A Brobdingnagian corn-popper was produced,
and one of the open fires being reduced to the
proper condition, a cheerful crackling began
as the corn bounded high in its ample prison.</p>

<p>“We’re in the land of bigness, Mrs. Nixon,”
said Mrs. Bruce, as they sat at a comfortable
distance from the heat.</p>

<p>“Indeed, yes,” returned that lady. “I was
just saying to Miss Maynard that apparently
the mountains set the pace here.”</p>

<p>As she spoke, Mrs. Nixon looked graciously
at her companion, who occupied a neighboring
chair.</p>

<p>“Were you, indeed!” thought Mrs. Bruce,
amused. “I’m glad you’ve found out you can
say something to the girl!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>“Irving,” she said aloud, looking up at her
son as he stood, tall and abstracted, staring
into the mammoth fire, “why don’t you take
Miss Maynard up to the Lookout. There
must be a glorious view from there to-night.”</p>

<p>Without moving, Helen lifted her eyes to
Irving and met his gloomy regard.</p>

<p>“I doubt if Miss Maynard cares to ascend
a perpendicular corduroy road,” he answered.
“I’m told it is eight stories up.”</p>

<p>“You might ask her,” remarked the girl
herself, with composure.</p>

<p>“Surely,” laughed Mrs. Bruce. “It would
be such a simple way of finding out.”</p>

<p>Irving had not the grace to smile. He continued
to regard the humble companion of
yesterday, the heiress of to-day, without
moving.</p>

<p>“Would you?” he asked sententiously.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied promptly, and rose.</p>

<p>The proposition was so foreign to Bruce’s
mood that it required a noticeable moment
for him to pull himself together sufficiently
to join the young lady with tolerable grace.</p>

<p>She gave him a comprehending glance as
they moved toward the staircase.</p>

<p>“Probably all your life,” she said slowly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
“you have done just what you liked. I have
never done anything I liked. I am beginning
to-night.”</p>

<p>He looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know you don’t want to do this,
but I do,” she added, “and that’s all I’m
going to think of. It’s my turn.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon and Mrs. Bruce followed them
with their eyes.</p>

<p>“What a little thing Miss Maynard is,”
remarked the latter. “See, she barely reaches
Irving’s shoulder. I’ve always said he’d marry
some mite of a creature. That’s the way tall
men always do, and then giraffes of women
have to mate with short ones.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry Robert wasn’t here,” said Mrs.
Nixon coldly. “He would certainly have
obliged Miss Maynard with a better grace.”</p>

<p>“Irving <i>is</i> terribly indifferent,” returned
Mrs. Bruce complacently. “If <i>I</i> want anything,
he’s all alive at once; but when it’s a
question of any other woman—” She finished
with a significant gesture.</p>

<p>“I have endeavored,” said Mrs. Nixon, with
stateliness, “to inculcate in Robert unvarying
courtesy to all women.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce began to grow warm under her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
ruching. “Yes, dear, I know,” she replied,
with a well-done sigh. “It’s so much easier
when a man hasn’t distinguished himself
especially at college. These football heroes—”
she shook her head regretfully—“they do get
spoiled, I admit, and grow careless. Then they
reflect very little credit on their bringing-up.
Excuse me a moment, Mrs. Nixon, I must
speak to Betsy.” And Mrs. Bruce rose gracefully
and departed on her fictitious errand
rather than sustain her friend’s possible rejoinder.</p>

<p>“For if,” she reflected, “the woman should
say anything really <i>against</i> Irving it would
spoil the rest of the trip. The idea! He might
have treated Miss Maynard outrageously
yesterday and Mrs. Nixon wouldn’t ever have
noticed it; but to-night she begrudges them
a moonlight excursion.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon leaned back in her chair,
breathing a little fast as her son and heir
approached her.</p>

<p>“Where were you, Robert?” she asked rebukingly.</p>

<p>“Pacing the deck outside. I’ve no ambition
to take the leading rôle in a barbecue.”</p>

<p>“It’s not so hot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, it’s better now. Where’s Brute?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon’s nostrils dilated. “Your very
well-named friend has taken Miss Maynard
up to the Lookout,” she returned suavely.
“He made it very evident that he went under
compulsion. I wished that you had been here.”</p>

<p>“Led him <i>to</i> it, did she?” Robert laughed.
“Good for her. I like to see Brute coerced.
And girls like to do it. She’s having the time
of her life, never fear.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. It is a very disagreeable
position for a young girl to be put in; and his
manner was atrocious.”</p>

<p>“Mother,” Robert shook a sapient finger
in her direction, “mother, there won’t be any
disagreeable positions for that young lady.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon regarded the speaker attentively.</p>

<p>“She strikes me as a person who has been
biding her time,” declared Robert. “At present
she has arrived; and although she doesn’t
make any fuss about it, that little hand of
hers, with no rings on it, is closing around the
tail of this giddy old world, and if it doesn’t
turn to suit her, I think you’ll find her giving
it a twist in the other direction.”</p>

<p>“I’m certainly at a loss to know what you
mean, Robert. She has always displayed excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
taste in her position. She has been entirely
quiet and docile.”</p>

<p>“Quiet, yes,” replied Robert with a laugh,
“but docile! That’s all you know about it.
My dear parent, mark my words. Don’t you
ever imagine that this is any <i>jeune fille</i> case,
needing protection. Miss Helen Maynard is
composed of two thirds sand and the other
third grit.”</p>

<p>The speaker closed his eyes and nodded his
head slowly in a manner to express conviction.</p>

<p>“Well! I had no idea you were such a student
of character.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” returned her son prosaically.
“Never see anything till it hits me
in the nose.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m very dull,” returned the other
with some hauteur, “for no such thing has
ever been obvious to me.”</p>

<p>“She’s fetching, oh, yes,” allowed Robert,
“and she’ll make other people fetch, too. It
cheers me to think she’s making Brute toil
up seven flights of log-stairs to look at the
moon with her.”</p>

<p>“She will be a success, just because she has
herself so well in hand,” declared Mrs. Nixon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
unwilling to view this subject lightly. “She
is not a beauty, but well-gowned and with her
self-possession she will pass for one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” agreed Robert lightly.</p>

<p>He had thrown himself into Mrs. Bruce’s
vacated chair, and there was silence for a span
while the two gazed at the fire; then the lady
spoke again, tentatively.</p>

<p>“However independent Miss Maynard may
be, she will require a chaperon now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, one well trained to follow at heel.”</p>

<p>“Robert, I wish you wouldn’t exaggerate
so.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, mamma mia,” looking up in
surprise at the impatient tone. “Why should
it make <i>you</i> peevish?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon’s reply was dignified. “Because
the duty may devolve upon me.”</p>

<p>“Heavens! Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, your uncle Henry is very much attached
to the girl. He has a natural interest
in her welfare.”</p>

<p>“Has he asked you to look after her?”</p>

<p>“He has suggested that we extend the hospitality
of our home to her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now!” ejaculated Robert.
“When I’m to have a sister, please select a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
nice pussy one with appealing eyes like—like
Hebe the Heaver, for instance.”</p>

<p>“There will be no sister about it,” returned
Mrs. Nixon sharply.</p>

<p>“Mamma, mamma!” Her son turned lazily
accusing eyes upon her. “Have you ulterior
motives? Are you laying any traps for your
little Robbie?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon gave a faint laugh in spite of
herself.</p>

<p>“My dear, I wish you weren’t quite such a
goose. Is it likely that I should expect you
to be interested in a combination of sand and
grit?”</p>

<p>Robert looked back at the fire. “There’s
no telling what a solicitous mother will expect
when there are shekels in the balance. It
would be a dangerous clash under the same
roof, for you know I’m two thirds brass and
the other third pure affection, and that’s a
mixture akin to dynamite.”</p>

<p>Silence again for a space.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do when we get
back to the Hub?” inquired Robert at last.</p>

<p>“We haven’t quite decided, your uncle
and I.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to Fairport to sail with Brute.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are? Well then, we shall be tempted
to follow. Is it a possible place outside the
cottages?”</p>

<p>“Quite so, Brute says. Getting more so
every year, because there’s a river flowing
into the sea that gives the variety of canoeing.
He says the Fairport Inn is getting to be quite
dressy.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t we all try it, then?” asked
Mrs. Nixon.</p>

<p>“All?”</p>

<p>“Yes, all. It would be the best of ways for
us to test Miss Maynard’s suitability. I shall
not ask her to live with us without your consent,
Robert,” finished Mrs. Nixon solemnly.
“The home-circle is sacred.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>AN EXODUS</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Whatever</span> interview Miss Maynard and
Bruce may have had in the Lookout of the
inn, it did not appear to have changed the
young man’s mood when later he sought his
stepmother.</p>

<p>She was in her bedroom wrapped in a negligée
when she admitted him.</p>

<p>“Was it very beautiful?” she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>“Very extensive; yes, fine,” he replied.</p>

<p>“You must take me up there to-morrow,
Irving.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I shall be here to-morrow.
That’s what I came to speak to you about.”</p>

<p>“Not be here!” repeated Mrs. Bruce in dismay.
“Why, look at this room, Irving.” The
speaker indicated the woodsy interior. “Isn’t
it perfectly enchanting? I was just asking
Betsy if she didn’t feel like a dryad.”</p>

<p>Irving glanced at Betsy, quite slim enough
for the rôle, laying out her mistress’s night
paraphernalia on a second bed in the opposite
corner of the green room. “I was just saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
I should like to stay here all summer. What
do you mean by to-morrow, Irving?”</p>

<p>“Nothing that need disturb you at all. I
hear alluring stories of fishing at the lake. I
thought I would go there and wait till you
came.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” returned Mrs. Bruce. “Is
Nixie going too?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t asked him yet. He may. I’ve
seen all I care to see here. Thought I’d come
and explain because I might get off before
you’re up in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh Irving, I don’t know that I want to
stay with Mrs. Nixon!” Mrs. Bruce’s tone
indicated that she had suddenly found her
doll stuffed with sawdust.</p>

<p>“Stay with Betsy and Miss Maynard then.
You have an embarrassment of riches.”</p>

<p>“Did you have a pleasant time with Miss
Maynard? What is the demure little creature
like when she gets off with a man?”</p>

<p>“Why, she gets on with him.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Irving.”</p>

<p>“She is interesting,” was the unenthusiastic
reply. “She finds the situation a little heady,
naturally.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s absurd to see Mrs. Nixon suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
so exercised about her. It may be catty
of me, but I was very glad you took her away.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, she took me away.” Irving’s tone
was colorless. While in the Lookout he had
brought the conversation round to Rosalie
Vincent. He had had a vague notion that this
new-fledged heiress might be the maker of
Rosalie’s pathway into more congenial surroundings;
but he had met cool indifference
on the subject.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Madama.” He kissed her forehead.
“Good-night, Betsy. If you’re not
down to speed the parting guest, I will expect
to see you some day on the shore of the lake,
hailing me. Have a good time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Irving!” began Mrs. Bruce, holding
open the door he tried to close; but he interrupted.</p>

<p>“Now get your beauty sleep, Madama. It’s
all settled. Good-night”; and the door closed.</p>

<p>The moon sailing over the Park sent a
stream of light into Irving’s bed-chamber.
He watched it move from log to log, from
wash-stand to chiffonier, and as it reached
each new object he felt a fresh access of impatience
at himself for wasting these silent hours.</p>

<p>He had seen Nixie before retiring, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
youth had jumped as joyfully at the fishing
scheme as any trout at the fly.</p>

<p>He had warmly declined to divulge his intentions
to the family.</p>

<p>“I will leave a note addressed to mother
on my table,” he announced. “It will ask
forgiveness and tell her that it will be of no
use to try to find me.”</p>

<p>“I have told Mrs. Bruce I’m going,” rejoined
Irving.</p>

<p>“With what result?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she didn’t like it. She’s crazy about
it here.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I say,” returned Robert
triumphantly. “There’s nothing like the note
on the dresser. It has stood the test of ages.”</p>

<p>And now Irving was wasting his time lying
awake and watching the stealing moonlight.</p>

<p>“Coffee never affected me before,” he considered
impatiently; then he sat up in bed and
punched the unoffending pillows into new
shapes and flung himself down on them.</p>

<p>He hoped <i>she</i> was not awake too. He lay
quite still for a minute, picturing an aureole
of golden hair, pillowed in a shabby room,
and stood in awe a minute before the innocence
of that childlike face in slumber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he suddenly punched his pillow again,
wishing it were the head of one who would
presently waken her and call her below stairs
to run patiently at the bidding of folk in a
ruffianly early-morning mood.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch in the moonlight.
The wonder is that his ireful gaze did not stop
the repeater at three <span class="smcap">A. M.</span></p>

<p>His window commanded the mound of geyserite
which made the inn famous. He leaped
out of bed on a chance that the view might
break the monotony.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he reached the window when,
in the lonely loveliness of the night, up sprang
the geyser—lowly at first, then higher and
higher—like a thing of life, leaping toward
the moon, scattering myriad diamonds from
its banner of cloud. No artificial light now
bathed its beauty. No crowd of humanity
encircled it like clustering bees. Alone in the
silvery light it mounted and mounted under
the brooding stars that knew it so well. They
sparkled, and beckoned to the beloved captive,
who, holding herself at full height, could
not quite reach their kisses, but sank back at
last, reflecting their brightness in her tears as
she vanished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“And Rosalie weeps. I know she does,”
thought Irving; “and I won’t stay to see it.”</p>

<p>He jumped back into bed.</p>

<p>“It’s a beastly shame that I can’t do anything
and nobody else will. Mr. Derwent says
she’s a relative, and then goes doddering
around and lets her bring him his coffee.
When he gets to the lake, I’ll have a few words
with him, Betsy or no Betsy. I’m just waiting
to see if he means to do anything of his own
accord. I wonder if my blood will run as cold
as that, when I’m fifty. One thing sure, I
shall never dare to fall in love, if just a matter
of ordinary humanity can stir me up like
this.”</p>

<p>The whack which his long-suffering pillow
received as punctuation to this muttered
speech was the last for that night. The philanthropist
sank to slumber and wakened with
a start and a sensation of being too late for
something important.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. It was just half
an hour to stage time.</p>

<p>He jumped up, dashed some cold water
over his head, pulled on some of his clothes,
and stuffed the rest into his suit-case, which
closed reluctantly and under the influence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
muttered incantations such as may proceed
from masculine youth in the anticipation of
a stage-ride of twenty miles on an empty
stomach.</p>

<p>Irving prided himself on being his own alarm-clock.
He had especially requested not to be
called, and in a nettled state of mind he finally
pulled open his door and nearly tumbled over
Betsy, seated in the corridor. Beside her on
the floor reposed a tray. Odorous steam was
rising from a brown pot thereon. She picked
up the tray.</p>

<p>“You’ve got ten minutes,” she said calmly.
“Open the door.”</p>

<p>She carried her fragrant burden into the bedroom
and set it on the table. Irving would
have followed that steam anywhere. He
dropped his suit-case and drew up a chair.</p>

<p>“Good fairy!” he exclaimed as she filled
his cup and he bit deep into the bread and
butter. “Good genius! Betsy, have I ever
been ungrateful to you? This ends it!”</p>

<p>She sat composedly, her watch in her hand.
“Do chew a little, Mr. Irving.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Sounds natural,” he said,
busily devouring and drinking.</p>

<p>“Time’s up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>He knew so well that she would give him
the limit, that he rose like a shot, and picked
up the suit-case.</p>

<p>“But why, Betsy,” examining her as they
fled, “why are you hatted and suited in so
finished a manner?”</p>

<p>“Because we’re goin’ with you,” replied
Betsy equably.</p>

<p>“What? Why?”</p>

<p>“Because Mrs. Bruce didn’t sleep any, and
neither did Mrs. Nixon; and we’re all goin’.”</p>

<p>There was no further time for talk. Irving
had had the forethought to pay his bill the
night before, and when he and Betsy stepped
into the last stage it had all the familiar appearance
of previous days except that no
waitress was shrinking in a corner like a violet
striving to hide beneath its leaves.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” said Robert cheerfully.
“United we stand, divided we fall. We’re
all going fishing.”</p>

<p>“Irving, come here.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce made room for him beside her,
and the stage started. She was pale, and had
made no effort to get the driver’s seat, where
Miss Maynard and Robert had climbed at
Mrs. Nixon’s suggestion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let some one sit up there who has had a
wink of sleep,” Mrs. Bruce had said sepulchrally.
“If I owned that inn, Irving Bruce,
I would sell it for twenty-five cents.”</p>

<p>“Well well!” responded her son, so fortified
by coffee and bread and butter, eaten where
he was not obliged to look upon a captive
maid, that he could smile. “I thought the inn
was enchanting you into remaining all summer.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” ejaculated Mrs. Bruce. “It may
be very fascinating by day; but by night it is
Hades, nothing less—not a whit less.” And
the speaker shook her head as one who should
say that hours of argument would not persuade
her to abate a jot of her denunciation.
“Did you sleep any, Irving?”</p>

<p>“Why—not much. I think it must have
been the coffee. You overdid it too, eh?”</p>

<p>“Coffee!” Mrs. Bruce glared palely at the
suggestion. “There were two men in the room
next to us. Logs between—nothing but logs.
Irving, wouldn’t anybody with any sense or
forethought have cemented between those
logs?”</p>

<p>“So picturesque,” murmured Irving.</p>

<p>“Don’t let me ever hear the word again,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
gasped Mrs. Bruce. “They said it all night.
Didn’t they, Betsy?”</p>

<p>“You said so, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“That’s it. I kept asking Betsy if she was
awake. Didn’t I, Betsy?”</p>

<p>“Yes’m.”</p>

<p>“And she knows how they talked. They
went out every hour—every hour, all night,
Irving.” Mrs. Bruce made the repetition with
an impressiveness mere print is powerless to
convey. “Went to see the geysers and then
slammed back into their room to talk about
them. Oh!!”</p>

<p>“Too bad, Madama! You’re quite tired
out. Now just rest a while. Don’t trouble to
talk.”</p>

<p>“And the radiator, Irving.” Mrs. Bruce
had not yet relieved her mind. “It cracked
all night. The apparatus must be put in
wrong. I called Betsy’s attention to it several
times. She’ll remember.”</p>

<p>Miss Foster looked as if the memory of the
night was liable to remain for some time as
green as the room Mrs. Bruce had waked in.</p>

<p>“The hotel should be thoroughly done over,”
declared Mrs. Bruce, “the walls chinked with
cement and the steampipes looked to, or else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
in common honesty a placard should be nailed
up, reading: ‘For show only!’ If ever I was
grateful for anything, it is that you had planned
to go this morning, anyway. I shouldn’t have
had the force to argue or persuade you.”</p>

<p>Irving thought of his own nocturnal perambulations,
and turned toward the seat
behind, where Mrs. Nixon was seated with her
brother.</p>

<p>Her countenance wore a forbidding expression.</p>

<p>“Were you unfortunate also?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Bruce,” she replied with deliberate
distinctness, “I should not expect it
to be a matter of general interest if I had been.
Perhaps you remember what Emerson says
apropos of retailing woes of that character
to one’s morning companions. I quite agree
with him.”</p>

<p>Having thus delivered herself, the lady’s
lips closed in the curves of beauty which
nature had bestowed upon them, and she
again gave her attention to the landscape.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce made a grimace as she met her
son’s amused eyes.</p>

<p>“Now,” she thought, “I suppose she thinks
she is even with me for last evening.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Derwent, unconscious of injuring his
sister’s effect, addressed Mrs. Nixon.</p>

<p>“You look done up, Marion. I am sorry you
passed such a disturbed night.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce pressed Irving’s arm and gave
him a malicious side glance.</p>

<p>“You should all be equipped like myself
for traveling,” continued Mr. Derwent rather
grimly, “and take off your ear when you go
to bed.”</p>

<p>“Poor gentleman,” thought Betsy. “How
gladly he would lie awake to hear his neighbors,
and if he could listen to the radiators
snap, it would be music to him, I’ve no
doubt.”</p>

<p>She glanced around at him. He had his
hands crossed on the head of his stick in his
usual posture.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I’ll ever dare talk to him! He
looked so kind at Rosalie yesterday. If the
fish bite good, perhaps Mr. Irving’ll forget
her. Here’s hopin’ they will! I meant to have
a real good visit with the child to-day. I must
send her a card when we stop for lunch.”</p>

<p>At the Thumb, Betsy had a chance to do
this.</p>

<p>As soon as Mrs. Bruce discovered that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
might make the remainder of their trip by
water, she urged it.</p>

<p>“I would just as lief go separately from
Mrs. Nixon,” she said to her son, “until she
has had a night’s sleep. Find out, Irving,
whether they’re going by boat.”</p>

<p>It proved that all the places on the boat
had been engaged, and as soon as Mrs. Bruce
discovered this, her desire to proceed in that
way was augmented; and many were the
alterations she suggested in a management
which contained possibilities of such poignant
disappointment as hers.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon preserved a magnificent silence;
but looked graciously upon her child, whose
sallies appeared to have amused Miss Maynard
out of her habitual demureness.</p>

<p>“They seem to get on very well together,”
she remarked to her brother at a moment
when they were alone.</p>

<p>He nodded. “Helen dares be a girl again,”
he announced. “There is a great weight off
her mind. Her cheeks seem to have grown
plump over night.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>BETSY’S GIFT</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Colonial Hotel that evening looked such
a haven of rest to tired wanderers, that as
soon as it was settled that they could get rooms
Mrs. Nixon and Mrs. Bruce were able to
smile on each other again.</p>

<p>The mountain lake lay calm in the waning
light, and strings of fish being brought in
caused excitement among the men.</p>

<p>“One thing you must do, Irving,” said Mrs.
Bruce, looking graciously upon Helen, “is to
take Miss Maynard to that place where you
stand on shore and catch trout, and then
whisk it right over into a boiling spring and
cook it before you take it off the hook.”</p>

<p>“Miss Maynard has only to command me,”
rejoined Irving.</p>

<p>“I am going fishing with Mr. Derwent,”
said Helen. So subtle were the changes in the
mental atmosphere of the last few days, so
complete the step from subserviency to
dominance, that any exhibition of coquetry
with the two young men would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
considered legitimate by their natural guardians.
It was the absence of all archness in the
girl that concerned Mrs. Nixon, and the quiet
declaration just made disturbed her.</p>

<p>She secured her son’s attention.</p>

<p>“You surely won’t oblige your uncle Henry
to act as cavalier to a young girl,” she said.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Robert. “Oh, you mean
the fishing.” He laughed with a mischievous
flash of the eyes which brought color into his
mother’s cheeks. “Afraid she’ll fish for him
as well as with him, eh? Well, I think perhaps
you have <i>raison</i>.”</p>

<p>“Robert, why <i>are</i> you such a tease? I wish
you would choose a time when I am not so
nervous and tired. I’ve never thought of such
a thing, foolish boy!”</p>

<p>“I told you to count ten before you asked
her to live with us.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you like her, dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think she’s good stuff; but—you
know what I told you. If she comes to live
with us, she’ll run the ranch. You hear me.
I don’t care to have anybody pull my wires.
When I hop, I want it to be from my own pure
lightness of heart.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon looked thoughtful. “I intend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to count ten, Robert. I told you that a month
at the Fairport Inn would reveal a great deal.”</p>

<p>“I think it will,” agreed Robert dryly.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile,” continued Mrs. Nixon with
some asperity, “you can either leave her
entirely to Irving Bruce or you can do your
part toward entertaining her.”</p>

<p>Robert threw an arm around his mother’s
shoulders and gave her a squeeze which
ruffled her dignity into a heap.</p>

<p>“You’re no wire-puller, honey,” he said.
“Better leave it alone.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon wriggled herself free.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bruce is so conceited about her stepson,”
she said warmly, “that I really have
some feeling about it, Robert. I confess it
frankly.”</p>

<p>“Well, mamma dear, they shouldn’t tease
her! As I’ve spent the whole day with Miss
Maynard, you should be satisfied with the
proof of your son’s fascinations. She might
have dived off the driver’s seat into Brute’s
arms, and she didn’t do it. Be comforted.”</p>

<p>“I know Mrs. Bruce will make Irving take
her to see the bears after supper. You watch!
And you might just as well do it yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” Robert shook his head. “I’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
rather be free to climb a tree. Speaking of
supper, come; and talk loudly, please, while
I take my first mouthful, so the guests won’t
hear it fall.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon sighed and went with him.</p>

<p>When the party rose from the table there
was a general movement to the back of the
hotel to view the bears.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce, quite restored by supper and
the prospect of a night’s rest, held Betsy’s arm
as a sign to Irving that he was at liberty.</p>

<p>He and Robert sauntered on together, talking
of the morrow’s fishing, and the others
followed.</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent was thoughtful. His sister
leaned on his arm and Helen walked on his
other side.</p>

<p>“So you were at school with Miss Vincent?”
he said.</p>

<p>“Yes; a short time. It seems Mrs. Bruce
gave her a short course.”</p>

<p>The girl’s tone was cool; but Mrs. Nixon
noted, as she had done before, the cleverness
with which she conveyed her distinct words,
and the ease with which her brother understood.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you like her very much?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, not especially. I had no occasion to
know her well.”</p>

<p>“H’m! She seemed to me so appealing.
Very modest and engaging.”</p>

<p>“I dare say she is,” returned Helen carelessly.
“Oh, there! See? That black bear
and her cubs!”</p>

<p>For the following fifteen minutes the party
watched the bears. They heard the mother
give the cubs warning under suspicion of a
cinnamon bear’s approach, and saw the babies
scamper fleetly up a tree, followed by mamma;
then, presently reassured, the whole family
came down and proceeded with their meal.</p>

<p>Wires were stretched to prevent the human
guests from trespassing beyond certain limits,
and soldiers were on duty, for it is difficult to
believe that the animals are not tame, and the
curious would approach them.</p>

<p>While the party watched, the cinnamon bear
did appear, headed for the garbage-heap, and
the house of black bear took to the woods in a
body. Then came a grizzly, and the conquering
cinnamon unostentatiously disappeared.</p>

<p>“It is very interesting,” wailed Mrs. Bruce,
“but why don’t the management provide
clothespins for the guests’ noses?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert had gravitated to Helen’s side.</p>

<p>“When we get across the Styx,” he murmured,
“I’m going to follow that woman up.
I’m as sure as if I’d seen it, that her halo won’t
fit.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Bruce is so nice to her!” said
Helen.</p>

<p>There was gayety that night in the hotel
office. An orchestra played, and there was
dancing. Both the young men danced with
Helen, then Irving wandered off to see about
fishing-tackle, and Robert floated on with the
girl, whose cheeks glowed.</p>

<p>“How well they dance together!” said Mrs.
Nixon to Mrs. Bruce complacently.</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned the latter. “Mr. Nixon
being shorter is a better height for her than
Irving.”</p>

<p>“Robert is quite tall enough,” said Mrs.
Nixon.</p>

<p>“Yes, for Miss Maynard,” returned Mrs.
Bruce.</p>

<p>Neither of them had slept as yet, and their
sitting together at all had a savor of reckless
daring.</p>

<p>Betsy was deeply engaged at the counter
where pictures and postal-cards were sold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she thought, “as it would
be anything out of the way if I should get
that whole set o’ postal cards and send ’em
to Hiram. Poor soul, he can’t travel any, and
they’d sort o’ illustrate my talk if I ever told
him anything about the trip.”</p>

<p>As she meditated thus, Betsy’s slow color
rose, for her New England conscience remarked
rather tartly that this plan for giving
pleasure to her patient admirer was not without
ulterior motives, and pretense was useless.</p>

<p>“Don’t I know,” she mused defensively,
“that it would just make Hiram’s life over
to have the child in his house? Old Mrs.
Bachelder would like nothin’ better than to
move all her traps over instead of comin’ by
the day.”</p>

<p>All of which goes to show that Clever Betsy’s
wits were still busy with Rosalie’s problem, and
that she desired to settle it without committing
herself to a surrender to the able seaman.</p>

<p>“As for postal cards, I guess I wouldn’t
have grudged Hiram that much pleasure if
Rosalie Vincent had never come to the Yellowstone;
and he and I—I mean he and
Rosalie can enjoy lookin’ at ’em evenin’s.”</p>

<p>Upon which, with conscious innocence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
a withering disregard of the presumptuous
inner voice, Betsy put down her money and
took the set of cards in its neat case.</p>

<p>As she did so, Mr. Derwent sauntered up
to the stand; the smile which always rested
more in his eyes than on his lips was evident
as he noticed Betsy’s concentrated interest.</p>

<p>“Finding some pretty things?” he asked.</p>

<p>She nodded vigorously. Mr. Derwent would
have been surprised to know how constantly
his image had held possession of this woman’s
thoughts since yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>Hiram Salter was a bird in the bush, and
no matter how wary, Betsy felt that she could
lure him—yes, upstart conscience, even
without the aid of postal cards!—to come to
her and eat out of her hand; but Mr. Derwent
was the bird already in that hand so far as
physical neighborhood was concerned. She
had wondered through many hours how she
could compass a conversation with the deaf
gentleman which others should not overhear.</p>

<p>Betsy looked wildly around for a likely spot
for a vociferous tête-à-tête. There was a
corridor which ran out of the large office in
each direction, and from which opened the
first-floor bedrooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Would the elegant Mr. Derwent think she
was quite mad if she endeavored to lead him
down one of these, and was there a chance of
her accomplishing the move without the observation
of the two tabby-cats? Yes, as a
truthful biographer I must admit that this was
the title bestowed by Rosalie’s champion
upon two complacent ladies since the playing
of the Riverside Geyser yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent’s voice interrupted her swift
thoughts.</p>

<p>“What have you been finding that is pretty?
Is there anything here I ought to get?”</p>

<p>Betsy repeated her vigorous nodding and
addressed the saleswoman.</p>

<p>“Let me see that water-color of the canyon
again, please.”</p>

<p>“A water-color, eh?” said Mr. Derwent;
then as Betsy looked at him in surprise, he
smiled again.</p>

<p>“These capricious ears of mine like a racket,”
he said. “The more the orchestra and the
clatter of voices and feet deafen you, the more
they make me hear. That’s pretty, that’s
very pretty.”</p>

<p>The clerk had produced the picture, and Mr.
Derwent gazed upon the waterfall, the spray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
dashing up its golden cliffs; and Betsy gazed
eagerly at him. He could hear her. That was
more exciting than the prospect of seeing on
the morrow this climax of beauty in the great
Park.</p>

<p>“We ought not to have looked at this until
after we had visited the canyon,” suggested
Mr. Derwent. “Paint is cheap, and disappointments
are bitter.”</p>

<p>“The picture’s just beautiful, though,”
said Betsy.</p>

<p>“And not a bit too bright,” declared the
clerk. “There couldn’t any picture do justice
to it.”</p>

<p>“You like it, do you, Miss Foster? Did you
buy one?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I’ve got a postal of it, though, in
this set of cards.”</p>

<p>“I will take this,” said Mr. Derwent to the
clerk, passing her the water-color.</p>

<p>While the picture was being put into its
envelope, and the clerk was making the change,
Betsy’s wits were working fast. How, <i>how</i> to
make the most of this golden opportunity!
She shrank from the appearance of begging
even for the winning girl she had left behind
her. It did not help matters nor lessen her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
embarrassment to have her companion hand
her the envelope containing the water-color.</p>

<p>“With my compliments, Miss Foster,” he
said with a bow.</p>

<p>“For me!” burst forth Betsy, flushing under
her mingled emotions.</p>

<p>“A souvenir,” he returned. “It is really
pretty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a gem, and I do thank you!” exclaimed
Betsy. “Oh dear, how can I now!”
was her mental moan. “It’s exactly like
sayin’ one good turn deserves another. I hate
to be those kind o’ folks that give ’em an inch
and they’ll take an ell.”</p>

<p>While she hesitated, fearing every moment
that the prize would turn and saunter back
to his people, Mr. Derwent lingered.</p>

<p>“I have been very glad,” he said, regarding
Betsy’s narrow, excited face, “of your kindness
to the little Miss Vincent.”</p>

<p>Now Rosalie was not little. She was an
upstanding daughter of the gods, meriting
their trite description; and the adjective
warmed Betsy’s heart and filled her with
courage. That, and the tone of the words,
gave her a welcome cue. She looked wistfully
into the kind eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s one o’ the hardest things I’ve ever
done to leave Rosalie at that inn,” she said.</p>

<p>“I didn’t like it either,” responded her
companion quietly. “Let us come over in
this corner and talk a bit.”</p>

<p>Betsy followed, an inward pæan of thanksgiving
going up from her good heart.</p>

<p>Irving was still talking fishing-tackle at a
desk at the opposite end of the office. Miss
Maynard was frisking in a two-step with
Robert, and the two mothers chaperoned her
gravely and with increasing sleepiness, while
the orchestra rang its rhythmic changes.
Betsy, standing a little at one side of the crowd,
told again the story of Rosalie’s life to an
attentive listener, who in his turn recounted
to her certain circumstances of the Vincent
losses.</p>

<p>“And it has come to this, has it,” said Mr.
Derwent, “that this young girl hasn’t a friend
in the world except you and me?”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” responded Betsy promptly.
“That is—” she added hurriedly—“we’re
the only safe ones she’s got.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” Mr. Derwent smiled leniently.
“A lover? I shouldn’t wonder at
that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, not a lover. I should hope not!
Good gracious!”</p>

<p>Betsy’s manner and precipitate speech
made Mr. Derwent smile again.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that big boy in our stage
with two mothers, neither of whom owns
him?”</p>

<p>Betsy’s wandering eyes looked so desperately
embarrassed that the speaker could not
forbear pressing her a little.</p>

<p>“Two mothers; one of whom he loves and
one who loves him.”</p>

<p>Miss Foster started. “Oh, Mr. Derwent,”
she gasped, and now her eyes met his in fright.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said, “whoever it is, I
think we shall be equal to the case without
his help. They tell me you’re called Clever
Betsy. Now let’s see whether you’re well-named.
Let’s talk ways and means a little.”</p>

<p>And Betsy did talk: talk as she had seldom
done since Irving’s mother went to sleep one
night in her arms.</p>

<p>She told Mr. Derwent of a friend of her
childhood, one Hiram Salter, and laid bare her
designs on that mariner’s hearth and home.</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent listened, nodding sometimes,
and when she had finished, he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“And this talent of Rosalie’s,—this elocutionary
business? Would there be any field
for her perhaps in Fairport, as a teacher?”</p>

<p>Betsy looked dubious. “Maybe. It’s a
pretty well-to-do village all times o’ year; but
that could come afterward. If I just once
knew she was safe in a home! She could likely
get into a school somewhere later.”</p>

<p>“Well-to-do, you say,” repeated Mr. Derwent
thoughtfully. “Do the people there
entertain? Parlor entertainments pay pretty
well.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Betsy slowly, fixing her interlocutor
with a gaze which little by little seemed to
see beyond him. “Folks there wouldn’t think
they could—spend money—that way—”</p>

<p>Her voice trailed off and there was a silent
space, while Mr. Derwent wondered at her
altered expression. Suddenly her gaze focused
on him again and her hard hands clasped the
water-color against her breast. “Mr. Derwent,
I’ve got an idea!” she said in a changed
tone.</p>

<p>“Of course you have,” he replied encouragingly.
“It’s a peculiarity of clever people.”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you what I’ve thought;” and
Betsy proceeded to do so with eagerness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“I believe it would work,” returned Mr.
Derwent thoughtfully, when she had finished.
“Follow that up, Betsy. May I call you
Betsy?”</p>

<p>“Of course, Mr. Derwent. I ain’t anything
else; and if you knew how I felt towards you
for befriendin’ Rosalie, you’d know that you
might call me anything.” Bright tears glistened
in the good gray eyes.</p>

<p>“The first thing to do, then, is to write
Rosalie a letter. Come, we’ll do it now,” he
answered. “I must talk with her. We will
have her come to the canyon.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>SUNRISE</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the following morning there was a reaction
of good spirits in all the party.</p>

<p>The men went out early on the lake, and the
ladies were enthusiastic over the trout they
ate for breakfast in consequence. Harmless
jests passed between the mothers; Helen Maynard
lost somewhat of her reserve, and as for
Betsy, her narrow face beamed upon everything
and everybody indiscriminately as the
party journeyed onward to the Canyon Hotel.</p>

<p>After luncheon they all drove to Inspiration
Point, and looked upon the Grand Canyon, the
sight of whose beauty is an epoch-making experience
in the life of the most blasé.</p>

<p>The Grand Canyon in Arizona is larger,
grander than perhaps any of the world’s
physical wonders; but it is too colossal to be
grasped. Its very distances are so vast that
a bluish veil seems hung before its battlements
and minarets, while its river, a mile below,
might as well be cotton wool lying stationary
in the depths. One sees without believing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
gasps without grasping. There is as much of
awe as of joy in beholding the Arizona wonder.</p>

<p>But in the Yellowstone lies a revelation of
beauty which bathes the soul in a dream
of loveliness, so surpassing, so overwhelming,
that it is inconceivable that one could receive
more into the ecstatic consciousness. Majesty
it has and impressive vastness; but not more
than can rejoice the eye and thrill the heart.</p>

<p>When finally the party were returning to
the hotel for dinner, Irving turned a grave
face upon Betsy’s glowing countenance.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to have anything on your
mind,” he said.</p>

<p>“Not a thing,” she rejoined promptly.</p>

<p>“I wish I could wash my hands of the affair
as easily,” he said crushingly.</p>

<p>“Mr. Irving,” a smile rippled over Betsy’s
thin lips, “I haven’t had a chance to tell you
that I talked with Mr. Derwent last night.”</p>

<p>“You did, eh?” The young man’s face
changed to alert attention.</p>

<p>“He feels just the way we do. It’s goin’ to
be all right.”</p>

<p>“<i>Jubilate!</i>” ejaculated Irving. “How?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t tell you now. You go right on
trustin’ me—or rather you’d better begin!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re a good soul, Clever Betsy! When
does she stop?”</p>

<p>“As soon as it’s right.”</p>

<p>Irving uttered an exclamation of impatience.</p>

<p>“Don’t show your ignorance o’ business
methods,” said Betsy smiling. “You go on
with your fishin’. Everything’s goin’ to be all
right, and I’ll tell you about it later.”</p>

<p>Thus reassured, Irving obeyed. He went on
fishing; he tramped to Artist’s Point with Miss
Maynard, Nixie, and Mr. Derwent, and at
night went to his rest without having cross-examined
Betsy further.</p>

<p>He knew every shade of expression in her
good, immobile face, and satisfaction was too
clearly writ upon it for him to doubt that all
was well. Let her have her little mystery, if
she derived enjoyment from it. Of course all
Irving cared for was to know that Rosalie
was properly looked after,—the details were
really immaterial.</p>

<p>Toward the following morning he found
himself on the shore of the Firehole River,
again waiting for the Riverside Geyser to play.
As the water began to spout, he suddenly
noticed that Rosalie Vincent was in a canoe
in the middle of the river, just in the path of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the irresistible liquid catapult. He flung off
his coat preparatory to jumping into the water,
and at the same time shouted her name
repeatedly.</p>

<p>A mixture of sheepishness and relief greeted
his sudden view of the ceiling of his bedroom.
His own voice rang in his ears. He glanced
at the window. Streaks of light were showing
in the sky. An idea occurred to him.</p>

<p>“I shall never have such another chance,”
he thought. In fifteen minutes more he was
dressed and stealing like a burglar down the
corridor and out the door of the hotel.</p>

<p>The sky was brightening fast, and he started
on a jog-trot in the direction of the canyon.</p>

<p>The stillness, the loveliness of that morning,—the
only sounds those of Nature undisturbed
and uninterrupted! What fine exhilaration
was in the air! Had no reward followed
that run over the mountain road, Irving Bruce
would have remembered it all his days as
unique in rare enjoyment; but when at last
he passed out from the shadows and stood
upon a vantage-point commanding the superb
gorge, what words can describe the grandeur
of the pageant, as the rising sun brightened the
flaming walls of the canyon, and whitened the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
tempestuous water which paused on an awful
brink before thundering into the deeps below,—a
compact mass of shimmering silver foam!</p>

<p>A strange ecstasy forced moisture into the
watcher’s eyes; but suddenly as his glance
swept down the cliff his heart seemed to stop
beating. On a jutting rock below him a woman
was standing. She wore a white gown
and was bareheaded. While he looked she
seemed to become terror-stricken, and retreating,
her back to the falls, clung to the hoary
rock like a frightened dove.</p>

<p>As in his dream Irving shouted, “Rosalie!
Rosalie!” but the mad roar of water fortunately
drowned his voice as he plunged down
the path that led to the jutting rock.</p>

<p>If the girl should faint or fall, there was
nothing to prevent her slipping over the edge
and rolling into the awful chasm, and it seemed
to the man an eternity before he scrambled
to a foothold beside her and seized the white
gown. She lifted dilated eyes to his face, then
gave a smile of heavenly relief and sank into
the arms that clasped her.</p>

<p>He scowled down while he held her close.</p>

<p>“Are you crazy?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Oh!” was all she could breathe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you faint!” he exclaimed again,
as ferociously as before.</p>

<p>“No—I won’t,” she murmured. She was
very white as she pushed herself from him.</p>

<p>He clasped her hand tightly.</p>

<p>“Don’t look down. Put your foot there.”
He indicated a spot with his own foot and
stepped ahead of her.</p>

<p>Thus, little by little, he led her upon the
steep trail, and they climbed to the upper
ground.</p>

<p>“That was a crazy thing to do!” repeated
the man when they stood in safety.</p>

<p>“The water—drew me,” she answered
faintly.</p>

<p>She was more than ever like a nymph, her
eyes appealing in her white face under the
gold of her hair.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you cold? Where are your wraps?”
viewing her white dress.</p>

<p>She looked about helplessly. “I had a
sweater. I must have dropped it somewhere.
No, oh no, Mr. Bruce;” for Irving was taking
off his coat.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Of course I shall. How many
layers do you suppose I need? See my sweater-vest?”
He put her arms in his coat-sleeves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and buttoned it close to her throat. “I’m
glowing. I ran all the way.”</p>

<p>“How wonderful that you came!” She said
it very quietly, apparently still under the spell
of her moment of panic.</p>

<p>He kept his eyes upon her. “I dreamed
about you. I dreamed that you were in
danger.”</p>

<p>She looked at him curiously. “Is that why
you came?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. Who can tell?” His face had
cleared, and he looked into hers, so still and
lovely above the rough coat. “I am very
angry with you, Rosalie.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, you can’t be. It looked very easy.
See.”</p>

<p>From where they stood, the jutting rock
below did look ample and tempting.</p>

<p>“But I’m sorry I frightened you,” she added,
and looked up at him with an enchanting
smile.</p>

<p>The new day had begun. The solemn pines
towered above them. On a crag below clung
an eagle’s nest, and the parent birds circled
and soared above the emerald-green river,
returning to the young with food.</p>

<p>“It seems,” said the man slowly, “as if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
were alone in this stupendously beautiful
world.”</p>

<p>“My head went round and round,” she
returned dreamily. “I wonder how long I
could have held there.”</p>

<p>He shuddered. “Did life suddenly seem well
worth living?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes indeed,” she returned. “It seemed
that, yesterday. A wonderful thing has happened
to me. I’m not a heaver any more.”</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it. When did you come?
What does it mean to find you here at dawn
as if you had rained from the skies?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Derwent doesn’t want me to stay
in the Park. He thinks there is other work I
can do. He cared a great deal for my father,
and for his sake he will take care of me and
guide me, he says, if I will be obedient.” The
speaker lifted her eyes again to those which
studied her. “It’s easy to be obedient to
pleasant orders, isn’t it? He wants to send
me right back to Boston.”</p>

<p>She paused, and Irving nodded with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I quite understand,” she went on quietly,
“why he wishes me to go a little ahead of your
party.” Irving frowned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s all right. I have felt very much humiliated—”
she went on.</p>

<p>“Absurd, ridiculous,” interjected Irving
hotly; but she finished her sentence as if he
had not spoken.</p>

<p>“Betsy says I am a vine, and wish too much
to cling, and haven’t backbone enough; but
Mr. Derwent’s interest puts backbone into
me. I feel that surely there is a place for me
somewhere—”</p>

<p>“Where,” interrupted her companion, “where
in Boston are you going?”</p>

<p>“He will take care of it all, he says. Isn’t
it wonderful? I don’t wonder that he loved
my father.” The girl’s eyes shone. “He says
that they were very close at one time, and that
old friends can never be replaced. It makes me
think of what Holmes said:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘There is no friend like the old friend, who has shared our morning days,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">No greeting like his welcome, no homage like his praise:</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fame is the scentless sunflower, with gaudy crown of gold;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But friendship is the breathing rose, with sweets in every fold!’”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The girlish voice was like music above the
smothered roar of many waters. As Irving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
listened and looked, he understood the warmth
of Mrs. Bruce’s brief enthusiasm.</p>

<p>There was a pause, and the two feasted their
eyes upon the glories before them.</p>

<p>“It is absurd that you shouldn’t go back to
Boston with us,” said Irving at last.</p>

<p>“I’d much rather not, Mr. Bruce. I fear
if Mr. Derwent had insisted on that, I should
have rebelled. You are kind to take an interest—”</p>

<p>“An interest!” burst forth Irving, and
arrested himself. He smiled. “Didn’t I pick
you off that cliff a few minutes ago?”</p>

<p>She looked at him with an expression which
nearly banished his self-control.</p>

<p>“We don’t hear much about man-angels,”
she said, “but you looked like one to me at
that moment—one of Botticelli’s—you know
how ready they always look to scowl?”</p>

<p>She laughed softly.</p>

<p>“I was furious with you,” said Irving. “So
remember I have part interest in you after this.
Mr. Derwent is all very well, but—</p>

<div class="center small">
“‘There is no friend like the old friend, who has shared our morning days.’<br />
</div>

<p class="unindent">These are our morning days, Rosalie.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the morning hours of them,” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
agreed. “Since I knew I was to leave to-day
I felt I could not waste the time in sleeping.
I wanted—oh! how I wanted—how I have
dreamed of seeing the sun rise in this canyon!
Perhaps,” she looked at him wistfully, “perhaps
it would have been my last sunrise but
for you.”</p>

<p>Irving’s heart beat faster, and his jaw set.
He could feel again the yielding form that had
clung to him.</p>

<p>“No one would have known,” she went on
in a dreamy tone. “Even Mr. Derwent would
have thought I had disappeared purposely and
would have marveled at my ingratitude; but—”
her voice changed and she looked up into
Irving’s eyes, smiling,—“they might all have
talked about me and said critical things, yet
Betsy would have believed in me,—believed
and suffered. Dear Betsy!”</p>

<p>“How about me? How about the friend of
your morning days?” asked Irving.</p>

<p>“Oh, you only began to be that this morning.
You would never have given the matter a
thought; and even Helen Maynard knows me
too slightly to have defended me.”</p>

<p>“Miss Maynard has found a gold-mine in
the Yellowstone. Did Mr. Derwent tell you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, indeed. What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“She turns out to be an heiress, and only
discovered it here.”</p>

<p>“How beautiful!” Rosalie’s eyes looked away
pensively. “Any fortunate discovery becomes
glorified by being made here. How happy she
must be! It is so fine to have time to work at
what you love to do!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Irving. “That is the
Eldorado for each of us.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘And only the Master shall praise us,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And only the Master shall blame;</span></div>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">For the God of Things as They Are!’”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Rosalie’s eyes were bright as she met his.</p>

<p>“And I think Mr. Derwent means to let
me work in my star. It’s such a little star,
but I feel it in me to succeed, and if the day
should come when I vindicate myself to—to
people that are disappointed in me now and
don’t understand, I shall be happy, <i>happy</i>.”</p>

<p>“Happiness is largely a matter of—of
friendship, as you said a few minutes ago,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
said Irving. “I want you to remember that
you may always call upon me; that I am at
your service. I swear you shall never be disappointed.”</p>

<p>Rosalie returned his earnest regard with
serious eyes.</p>

<p>“You saved my life,” she said.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” he returned. “You
would have stooped in a minute and crept
to a place of safety on the trail.”</p>

<p>“Then why were you so savage with me?”
she asked. “It would have been necessary for
me to stand up on that rock, and to take a
short step across to terra firma. It seems as
if I never could have done it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. The giddiness would have passed
in a minute, and you would have done it.
Self-preservation is the first law of life.”</p>

<p>Rosalie shook her head slowly. “Then you
have a bad temper. You were frightfully
cross.”</p>

<p>“That was merely discipline. You should
never go to a place like that unless I am with
you.”</p>

<p>“You!”</p>

<p>The girl’s tone of extreme wonder brought
the color to her companion’s face. He replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
however, with <i>sang-froid</i>. “Yes. I’ll take you
down there now if you’d like to try it again.”</p>

<p>She shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “Discreet second thought,
eh?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not afraid, with you,” she replied
quietly. “But I don’t care to go again.” A
pause, then she continued: “I must go back
to the hotel. I leave to-day.”</p>

<p>“And we to-morrow. It is a shame. I wish
you’d let me—”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Bruce, not for anything,” she
returned earnestly. “Let Mr. Derwent take
care of it, and—if we meet again here, will
you kindly not talk to me?”</p>

<p>“Just as you say. I will go back to the hotel
with you now; but this is our good-by. Give
me both your hands, Rosalie.”</p>

<p>She obeyed. Their eyes met. She colored
richly, looking like an embodiment of the
morning as she stood against the sombre green
of the stately pines. Freedom was before her:
freedom to live, and to work, with the knowledge
that she was no longer alone in the world.
That was cause enough for the happiness that
shone in her eyes; but that was not filling her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
thoughts to overflowing while Irving clasped
her rough little hands close. It was the remembrance
of the pounding terror of his heart in
the moment when they had clung together on
the dizzy rock.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget, Rosalie. I am your ally.”</p>

<p>She stood silent, her starry gaze not dropping
before his.</p>

<p>“Friendship is going to mean a great deal to
us,” he went on. “I feel it. Remember; for—</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>HOMEWARD BOUND</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Betsy Foster awoke that morning she
was full of excitement.</p>

<p>She assisted Mrs. Bruce as usual with her
toilet, and at the first possible moment hastened
to the apartment of her contraband
protégée.</p>

<p>She found Rosalie in her cheap traveling
dress of golden brown, and with her hat on.</p>

<p>She was sitting before a table on which was
a breakfast-tray, and she was sipping coffee.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Betsy. Come and see the
lay-over,” she said. “I feel still as if I needed
identification.”</p>

<p>The night before, her supper had been
served in the same way and place by Mr.
Derwent’s order, and he and Betsy had, unsuspected,
spent an hour here with the girl,
planning her movements, and allowing her new
benefactor to become somewhat acquainted
with his old friend’s daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent had no desire to stir up questioning,
and there was every chance now that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Rosalie would get off by the morning stage
without being observed.</p>

<p>“Is it really I, Betsy, sitting here and being
waited on like this, and being cared for by
such adorable people?”</p>

<p>The girl had risen on Betsy’s entrance, and
embraced her, pressing her fresh cheek against
the thin one where a bright spot burned.</p>

<p>“Now, now, you can hug me a fortnight
hence,” said Betsy. “Sit down and finish your
breakfast.”</p>

<p>She glanced at the bed. The coverings were
neatly laid over the foot-board, and the pillows
were plump and smooth.</p>

<p>“How did you sleep, child?” she continued
as Rosalie returned to her coffee. “The pillows
look as if you hadn’t touched ’em.”</p>

<p>“I don’t always use a pillow,” returned the
girl evasively.</p>

<p>“You look kind o’ pale. I don’t believe you
slept real good.”</p>

<p>“What does it matter?” Rosalie held her
friend with wistful, glowing eyes. “Why should
one lose the consciousness of happiness even
for ten minutes?”</p>

<p>There was a little contraction of Betsy’s
heart. So young a creature to be economical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of happiness; but the intensity of the girl’s
eyes disturbed her.</p>

<p>“Now you mustn’t get so wrought up over
things, Rosalie. Make it a rule to be mejum
in everything. I always have, and I find it the
best way.”</p>

<p>A low laugh escaped the girl as she met the
kind gaze. Had Betsy ever stood in the midst
of roaring immensity, an atom in the whirl of
colossal, dreadful beauty, and fallen from dire
panic into the close embrace of safety, with
the beat of a kingly heart upon hers? Poor
Betsy! Poor everybody in the wide universe
except Rosalie Vincent!</p>

<p>The good woman went on talking, and the
girl heard not a word. She was back beneath
the pines watching the eagles at their nest, in
a rainbow chasm.</p>

<p>“Gracious, child!” said Betsy at last, laughing
and pulling the suit-case out of Rosalie’s
hands. “You look like a sleep-walker; let me
put those things in there. And now you stay
right here until I come back and tell you when
to come downstairs. What have you got to
keep you warm? It’ll be cold stagin’ to-day.”</p>

<p>“I had a sweater,” said Rosalie absently.
“I lost it somewhere in the canyon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“In the canyon?” repeated Betsy mechanically.
Then she repeated the words explosively.
“What do you mean, Rosalie Vincent?
Have you been out there this mornin’?”</p>

<p>Rosalie looked the picture of detected guilt.</p>

<p>“Well I guess you <i>are</i> a genius! You’re as
crazy as the best of ’em.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have had me leave this
place without seeing it?” said the girl.</p>

<p>Betsy bit her lip. “Well, I guess that’s
about so,” she said. “It <i>would</i> seem cruelty;
but you see Mr. Derwent thought you’d
better be ahead of us, and he and I both know,
if anybody does, what it is to stir up a strife
o’ tongues! And I s’pose in the hurried arrangement
everything sort o’ slipped into
insignificance compared to smugglin’ you out
o’ the Park.”</p>

<p>Betsy’s tone had turned from accusation
to apology. “So you really have seen the
canyon,” she added, pausing, and regarding
the pale face.</p>

<p>“I saw the sunrise there,” returned Rosalie.</p>

<p>“My stars!” ejaculated Betsy. “If I could
see that, seems if I wouldn’t care if I never
saw another sight in this world.”</p>

<p>“I don’t,” returned Rosalie quietly; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
blue gaze went far beyond Betsy’s sallow,
wondering countenance. “I was born again
in the canyon.”</p>

<p>Her look startled Betsy. “Be mejum, Rosalie,”
she said. “You’ll wear yourself out if
you feel too much. Be mejum. It’s a splendid
rule.”</p>

<p>It came about that Mr. Derwent effected
his protégée’s departure without disturbance.</p>

<p>Betsy complained to Mrs. Bruce of the cold
of the morning and advised her not to stand
on the veranda to view the loading of the
stages. Mrs. Nixon would not do this in any
case, and Robert had taken Helen out for a
stroll.</p>

<p>Only Irving Bruce paced the piazza among
the crowd, and when Mr. Derwent put Rosalie
into the stage he met her eyes once.</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent saw him, and wondered if he
had recognized the brown bird. He prepared
himself for an explanation, and approached
the young man.</p>

<p>“Pretty snappy drive they’re in for this
morning,” he said.</p>

<p>“It is rather fresh,” replied the latter. “I
was just wondering if Miss Vincent had wraps
enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Derwent regarded him curiously. “You
recognized her then?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I take great interest in that girl,” said
Mr. Derwent.</p>

<p>“I am not surprised.”</p>

<p>“I am sending her out of the Park.”</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t, I should,” said Irving.</p>

<p>“It’s scarcely a case for your assistance,”
returned Mr. Derwent dryly. “But I wish to
say that I appreciate your refraining from
approaching her just now.”</p>

<p>Irving thought of the white dove that had
clung to his breast.</p>

<p>“You showed good taste,” went on Mr.
Derwent, “and an appreciation of the fact
that this is a case where ‘the least said, the
soonest mended,’ applies.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” answered Irving equably; and
Mr. Derwent, once more nodding approval
of him, went into the house.</p>

<p>What a drive it was that morning for Rosalie!
Betsy had wrapped around her, beneath
her coat, a woolly “fascinator” of her own,
and even without it, it is doubtful if the girl
would have recognized temperature. Every
little creature of the woods, as it came fearlessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
from its covert, seemed to congratulate
her on being alive with them; like them safe
from being hunted, free to love, to work.</p>

<p>Arrived at Norris for luncheon, who should
come to wait on her at table but Miss Hickey.</p>

<p>The young woman stood above the blonde
girl’s chair, and impersonally called the menu
to whomever it might concern.</p>

<p>Rosalie looked slowly around at her, her
golden-brown veil pushed up from her face.</p>

<p>“Miss Hickey,” she said softly.</p>

<p>“Goodness, Baby! <i>You!</i>”</p>

<p>The waitress’s eyes stared and snapped;
but business pressed, and it was not until the
end of the meal, when Rosalie lingered for the
purpose, that Miss Hickey had opportunity
to slake her burning thirst for information.</p>

<p>“Been fired?” she asked sympathetically.</p>

<p>“No, I left.”</p>

<p>“Struck a gold mine? How are you goin’
to pay your way back?”</p>

<p>“Some friends are sending me back.”</p>

<p>Miss Hickey eyed her scrutinizingly. “You
look as happy as if you’d lost twenty-five
cents, and found ten dollars.”</p>

<p>“I am happy. Oh, Miss Hickey, I’m so
happy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who’s with you, Baby? I’ll skin ’em if
they’re doin’ you mean.”</p>

<p>“No one’s with me. I’m all alone. I’m
going to Boston alone.”</p>

<p>“Sent? Or sent <i>for</i>?” inquired the other,
still unsatisfied.</p>

<p>“Sent,” returned Rosalie with a seraphic
smile.</p>

<p>“By those folks you were scared of?” asked
Miss Hickey, with sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>“No, the other people. Do you remember
the deaf gentleman with gray hair?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t, Blue-eyes.” Miss Hickey
spoke sharply. “The grayer they are, the
worse they are. That’s <i>my</i> experience.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s so good!” exclaimed Rosalie,
“and he is a friend of my father’s, and he
wants to help me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope he does. How’s that grand
young feller, Mr. Bruce. Seen him lately?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve seen them all. They’re enjoying
the Park. How have you been, Miss Hickey?
I can’t realize it’s only a few days since I saw
you. It seems years.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve been busier’n a nest o’ snakes,
doin’ nothin’. Been laid up most ever since
you were here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m afraid the Swattie ball was too much,”
returned Rosalie, smiling; “and I’m sorry, so
sorry!”</p>

<p>She put out her hand.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to go without seeing you
again,” she went on, giving Miss Hickey’s a
tight pressure. “I shall always remember you
gratefully.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad to see you too; and see
you in so much luck. I hope it’s all right.”
The black-eyed girl spoke doubtfully.</p>

<p>“The rightest thing in the world,” returned
Rosalie; and black eyes, no matter how sophisticated,
could not meet hers and doubt it.</p>

<p>“You’re goin’ right on to the Mammoth?”
inquired Miss Hickey.</p>

<p>“Yes, and leave there to-night.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you the grand lady! What’s your
hurry?”</p>

<p>“Why,” Rosalie smiled mischievously, “those
other people—the ones I was afraid of—will be
here to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Hot on your trail, eh?” said the other.
“Well, you’re a galoot to go alone, when you
might be in the stage with Mr. Bruce. If he’s
comin’ here to-morrow I’ll be on the watch
for him, believe <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>There were showers of rain and hail all the
afternoon while Rosalie coached to the Mammoth
Hot Springs. When the girl saw again
the veranda where she had trembled behind
Miss Hickey’s shoulder, it seemed to her that
a magic wand had transformed her life; and
so it was. All the way she found her path
smoothed by the forethought of her benefactor;
and the long journey to Boston was made
with no consciousness of care or tedium.</p>

<p>The newly-fledged, exultant heiress left behind
at the Colonial Hotel little knew that
the famous lawyer through whom her own fortune
had found its rightful owner had bestowed
still greater relief and courage upon her humble
school friend.</p>

<p>Clever Betsy kept her poise admirably.
She did not approach Mr. Derwent, nor ask
him a question.</p>

<p>When the party returned to Norris they
little suspected how a pair of black eyes in the
dining-room were, in Miss Hickey’s vernacular,
“sizing them up.”</p>

<p>Had burning glances visible effect, Mr. Derwent’s
scrupulously brushed head would have
shown several bald spots. The examination
was on the whole satisfactory, and, joyous to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
relate, Miss Hickey succeeded in waiting upon
Irving Bruce.</p>

<p>He came to luncheon a little late, and thus
sat away from his party.</p>

<p>As he ate his dessert, to his surprise the
waitress lingering beside his chair opened her
lips and spoke.</p>

<p>“I remember you folks real well,” she said.
“I was in your stage when you come on from
Mammoth.”</p>

<p>Irving glanced up, and as her words reached
his abstracted consciousness, he looked suddenly
interested.</p>

<p>“You were with Miss Vincent, then,” he
replied.</p>

<p>“M’hm,” admitted Miss Hickey with elegant
ease. “I seen her yesterday,” she added,
as the young man did not press the matter.
“She’s quit.”</p>

<p>“You saw her yesterday?” he repeated
eagerly. “How was she?”</p>

<p>“Oh-<i>ho</i>!” ejaculated Miss Hickey, mentally.
“You take notice, do you?”</p>

<p>“Perter’n a chipmunk,” she returned aloud.
“Say,” meeting Irving’s uplifted gaze, “is that
gent with the bum ear, the deef gent, I mean,—is
he on the level?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why—certainly. Did—did Miss Vincent—”</p>

<p>“Yes, she did. She told me he was sendin’
her back. Say; do you know her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, slightly.”</p>

<p>“Then you know that she’d believe Satan
if he smiled on her. I’d like to know that she’s
in good hands. That’s what I’d like to know.”</p>

<p>Irving Bruce smiled upon Miss Hickey, a
bright light in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you see the thin-faced lady over there,
the one with the brown waist?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Sure. The hatchet-faced one.”</p>

<p>“Miss Vincent is in her hands,” said Irving;
“and they’re the best hands in the world.”</p>

<p>He rose.</p>

<p>“Well, believe <i>me</i>, I’m glad to hear it,”
was the hearty response.</p>

<p>Irving smiled upon Rosalie’s friend again,
and gave her a tip which not only supplied her
with candy for weeks to come, but gave her
food for thought as well.</p>

<p>“Maybe I didn’t butt in just right!” she
reflected. “Oh, he’s just grand! Good for
Baby! I guess she’s goin’ some!”</p>

<p>Betsy bided her time. She was sure that
before the party reached Boston, Mr. Derwent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
would again open the subject of their mutual
interest.</p>

<p>Irving’s silence upon it awakened no suspicion
in her faithful breast. She had assured
him that all was well, and adjured him to trust
her; and, his mind set at rest, the thought of
Rosalie had slipped out of it, which, considering
that he belonged to Mrs. Bruce, was the
best thing that could happen.</p>

<p>Betsy’s expectation was well-founded. One
afternoon after their train had left Chicago,
and there came a lull in the interminable
games of bridge which had whiled the hours
away, Mr. Derwent approached the seat where
Betsy sat alone, viewing the flying landscape—flat
but not unprofitable.</p>

<p>“May I sit here a minute?” he asked.</p>

<p>She gave him a one-sided smile of welcome.
A veil was wrapped around her head in much
the same fashion in which she wore a cheese-cloth
on cleaning days at home.</p>

<p>They talked for half an hour; the noise of
the train increasing, as it always did, the ease
of Mr. Derwent’s hearing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce glanced at them more than once,
well pleased with the satisfied expression on
her handmaid’s countenance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>She addressed Mrs. Nixon.</p>

<p>“What an extraordinarily kindly man your
brother is!” she said.</p>

<p>“The best in the world,” agreed Mrs. Nixon
impressively.</p>

<p>Had either of them heard the directions he
was giving Betsy at that moment, they would
have edited their praise.</p>

<p>Helen Maynard and both the young men
were occupying a section opposite, showing
one another card tricks, and Mrs. Nixon and
Mrs. Bruce with quiet minds discussed their
summer wardrobes, and the Fairport Inn.</p>

<p>By a strange coincidence the subjects being
discussed by Betsy and Mr. Derwent were
precisely the same.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>MRS. BRUCE’S HEADACHE</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">“<span class="smcap">Be</span> it ever so humble,” said Mrs. Bruce,
“there’s no place like home!”</p>

<p>She was standing again on the veranda of
her summer cottage, where Betsy was airing
and beating pillows.</p>

<p>“Pretty good place,” agreed Betsy. “I’m
glad I ain’t goin’ to see a trunk for months;
but—” she hesitated unwontedly, and then
continued, “I’d like to go to Boston for a
couple o’ days, Mrs. Bruce, if you can spare
me.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, when we’ve just arrived?”</p>

<p>“The cook’s all right, and you’ve got Mr.
Irving and his friend both here—”</p>

<p>“A lot of good they are,” retorted Mrs.
Bruce. “They’ve lived with Captain Salter
ever since we came.”</p>

<p>Betsy said nothing. Mrs. Bruce had the
uncomfortable realization which seized her
at times that, although her None-such went
through the form of asking her permission, she
would in fact do exactly what she thought best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s such a queer thing for you to want to
do, Betsy,” she continued, “to go back into
the heart of the city immediately. Of course
Mrs. Nixon felt obliged to stay a few days with
Miss Maynard, to order some gowns—”</p>

<p>“Do you want to send her any word?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I promised to look at the rooms at the
inn and see what they had.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I do that for you?” asked Betsy.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I wish you would.”</p>

<p>“I can go this afternoon just as well as not,”
remarked Betsy quietly.</p>

<p>“Don’t it beat all, the way things come
round all right if you just don’t fidget?” she
thought.</p>

<p>The middle of the afternoon found her on
the way to the pretty inn, set on a slight rise
of ground above the river. Mr. Beebe, the
proprietor, was a Fairport man, an old friend
of Betsy’s, whose provincial ideas had for
years been in process of changing and forming
by contact with the summer people for whom
he catered; and what had once been a barn-like
structure known as the Fairport Hotel,
now showed as a modern inn, with verandas
and a pretense to fashion.</p>

<p>Mr. Beebe welcomed Betsy with effusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
rallied her on her travels and her worldly
experience, and at last settled down to listen
to her business.</p>

<p>When finally she arose to go, he remarked:—</p>

<p>“Well, seems if there wasn’t any end to
the new-fangled notions a feller’s got to listen
to and adopt to keep up with the times. I
haven’t forgot how clever you were to my
wife when she was sick a couple o’ years ago,
and I don’t like to turn down anything you
ask of me.”</p>

<p>“I appreciate your kindness, Sam, but you
ain’t goin’ to lose money by this plan. You
know we are all pretty proud o’ the Inn. If
Mrs. Bruce wasn’t she’d never a recommended
it to the Nixons. They’re folks that are used
to the best; and we’d like to see it have all
the attractions any resort has. Mark my
words, you’ll thank me for this, instead o’ me
you, though I ain’t underratin’ your good
feelin’. Good-by, Sam.”</p>

<p>Clever Betsy left the place with a springing
step.</p>

<p>She found her mistress in a rather injured
frame of mind when she reached the cottage.
It wore upon the lady that the None-such was
going to desert her post for two days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the worst of having a person like
Betsy,” she thought; “one gets so dependent.
It’s humiliating. I feel just like asking her not
to go, but I couldn’t bring myself to do that.”</p>

<p>So Mrs. Bruce compromised by being silent
and wearing an abused air.</p>

<p>“Once in a while Betsy will do a real selfish
thing,” she reflected; and she demanded of
memory to stand and deliver the last occasion
when her housekeeper had displayed base ingratitude.
Memory appearing to find the
task difficult, she resorted to deep sighs and
an ostentatious headache.</p>

<p>Betsy was amused, but also somewhat
touched.</p>

<p>“She ain’t anything but a child, never was,
and never will be,” she thought. “You can’t
get out of a barrel what ain’t in it.”</p>

<p>She told her mistress of the pleasant rooms
at the inn available because of having suddenly
been given up by their usual occupants.
“I’ll go see Mrs. Nixon and tell her about
’em,” she added. “Mr. Beebe’s promised to
hold ’em till Wednesday.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce put her hand to her forehead,
but apparently was too far gone, sunk among
her cushions, to reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think it would be real nice for you to do
a lot o’ sailin’ while I’m gone,” said Betsy
cheerfully.</p>

<p>“That’s just about as considerate as you
are!” returned Mrs. Bruce, with remarkable
fire for one in the languorous stage of headache.
“You know very well that at the best of
times I don’t care very much for sailing.”</p>

<p>“I thought with Mr. Irving and Cap’n
Salter both, you felt real safe, and enjoyed it,”
said Betsey pacifically; and Mrs. Bruce had
sundry disconcerting memories of hiking hilariously
with her hand on her boy’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Don’t you suppose,” she said with a
superior air, “that I ever make a pretense of
enjoying things for Irving’s sake?”</p>

<p>Betsy’s lips twitched. “You acted so natural
you took me in,” she returned meekly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce sank back again among her
pillows.</p>

<p>“I’ll make out a list for all the meals while
I’m gone,” said Betsy comfortingly, “and
give it to the cook. You see, Mrs. Bruce, one
o’ my friends that’s lived in the country and
is very inexperienced, wants to get a few
clothes in the city. She don’t know where to
go or what to pay, and I told her I’d come in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
for a couple o’ days and help her. You won’t
scarcely miss me before I’m back.”</p>

<p>“I must say, Betsy,” declared her mistress
faintly, “some people would have waited until
there was no guest in the house.”</p>

<p>“I’m real sorry I can’t wait,” returned
Betsy gently; “but I’m goin’ to arrange for
the meals, as I say, so you won’t have a mite
o’ trouble, and Mr. Nixon always makes
everything jolly.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce made no reply, and Betsy left
the room.</p>

<p>Going out on the street, she heard a piercing
whistle down the street, executing a classic
which would inspire a bronze image to cake-walk.</p>

<p>Betsy did not attempt any fancy steps,
but she started on a long, energetic stride in
the direction of the shrill ragtime.</p>

<p>She waved her hand with a gesture which
she knew would check Robert’s effervescence.</p>

<p>He waved his cap in return.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mr. Irving?” she asked as soon
as he could hear her.</p>

<p>“He’s helping Cap’n Salter with the sail.
They didn’t appreciate my services, so I
came away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>“I just wanted to tell you, Mr. Nixon, that
I’m goin’ to Boston.”</p>

<p>“Giddy creature! The whirl of the city
drawing you so soon?”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to tell your mother what rooms
there are at the inn, and if you have any
message—”</p>

<p>“I have. Tell her it’s great here, and to
let me know as soon as she’s through using
the car, because I want to bring it down—or
up.”</p>

<p>“I will. Say, Mr. Nixon,”—they were
strolling toward the house, Betsy hanging
back unaccountably,—“I hope you and Mr.
Irving’ll be sort of attentive to Mrs. Bruce
for a couple o’ days.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing. I’m eternally attentive to
her. What’s up?”</p>

<p>“Well—she doesn’t like to have me go;
has the habit of me, you know; and I’ve got
to go, that’s all there is about it.”</p>

<p>“Sad! sad!” ejaculated Robert. “Frightful
thing—habit. You seemed so mild out in the
Yellowstone I hadn’t an idea you couldn’t
endure the quiet of the country a week.”</p>

<p>“Now I’m relyin’ quite a lot,” said Betsy,
“on your foolishness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“What?” inquired the young man, his voice
breaking.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bruce can impose on Mr. Irving—I
mean,—you know what I mean, she can
make him fall in with her moods; while you—well,
you’re just as good as a rattle to—”</p>

<p>“Betsy,—now, Betsy, beware! I have
average poise, I hope, still I’m only human.
My head can be turned!”</p>

<p>Betsy smiled. “I don’t know as I exactly
make you understand what I mean—”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you do. Your meaning is as clear
as clear limping water. Please don’t be any
more definite or I may burst into tears; and
it’s in every etiquette book that I ever read,
that it isn’t proper to make the company
cry.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the way,” said Betsy with
satisfaction. “Just chatter to her like that,
and she’ll—”</p>

<p>“Betsy! Cruel one! How can I impress
you!”</p>

<p>“Now listen,”—they were drawing near
the house—“Mrs. Bruce’ll act sick when
you go in. I don’t mean she’s actin’, but she
don’t like things to go the way she hasn’t
planned ’em; and she’s a real dependent little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
lady, and you and Mr. Irving must keep her
as happy as a lark while I’m gone. I’ve got
to get off early in the mornin’, and I may not
get a chance to see him alone at all; so you
tell him I’m real sorry, and I’ll hurry back,
and you take her with you everywhere, and
look out for her and—and I’m goin’ around
this back way. She’s right in the livin’-room.
You’ll find her.”</p>

<p>Betsy disappeared with guilty haste, and
Robert, smiling to himself and whistling softly,
mounted the steps.</p>

<p>“Once there was a book,” he thought,
“named ‘Pink and White Tyranny.’ Madama’s
an anachronism. She belongs in it.”</p>

<p>He presented himself cap in hand at the
door of the room where Mrs. Bruce lay motionless
on a thickly pillowed divan.</p>

<p>“Any admittance?” he asked.</p>

<p>The sufferer stirred. “Is that you, Nixie?”
she returned faintly.</p>

<p>He advanced to the divan. “Dear me, what’s
this? You were so fit this morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve been quite upset.”</p>

<p>“You look it. Absolutely knocked down.
Nothing serious, I hope?”</p>

<p>“Where’s Irving?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mending a sail with Captain Salter. They
were so disrespectful to me that I came home.”</p>

<p>“I’m very poor company, I’m afraid,” said
the hostess languidly.</p>

<p>“But at least you appreciate me, Mrs. Bruce.
You don’t hurt my feelings every second word
you utter. Mayn’t I sit here by you,”—the
speaker took a chair close to the divan,—“and
rub your head, perhaps? My mother
will tell you I’m a cracker-jack at it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce gave an inarticulate exclamation
of dissent.</p>

<p>“I should expect you to rub my hair off,”
she exclaimed faintly.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look like that kind,” returned
Robert innocently.</p>

<p>Her eyes were closed, but she could feel his,
brightly curious, fixed upon her coiffure.</p>

<p>“You make me nervous, Nixie. Would you
mind taking a book?”</p>

<p>“A thousand pardons, dear hostess! Of
course I will. I did just want to ask your advice
about the car, though.”</p>

<p>“What car?” Mrs. Bruce’s eyes opened.</p>

<p>“Ours. I think when mother gets through
dressing Miss Maynard, we’d better have it
here. Don’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>“The roads are excellent,” replied the prostrate
one.</p>

<p>“Of course it’s Uncle Henry’s car, but it’s
all in the family.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t one, just now,” said Mrs.
Bruce. “We sold it when we went to Europe;
and Irving is such a merman we thought we
wouldn’t do anything about a new one till we
went back to town.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you have an electric for yourself,”
said Robert.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have one as soon as we get
back. I’ve always thought I was too timid
to drive it, but of late I’ve come to feel that
I don’t like to be the only woman that hasn’t
one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are just the person to drive an
electric,” said Robert, his eyes twinkling as
Mrs. Bruce unconsciously raised herself to a
sitting posture among the pillows. “You’ll
spin down to the bank every afternoon and
bring Brute home.”</p>

<p>“I really do think you’re right, Nixie,”
returned his hostess plaintively. “I have a
very cool head, and it’s all nonsense that I
couldn’t drive an electric even in the Boston
cowpaths, while in the Parks—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, my dear Mrs. Bruce, never think that
Brute will accompany you there!”</p>

<p>“Why not?” The question had all the
usual crispness.</p>

<p>“Such a stately method of locomotion will
not commend itself for his sportive hours.
What car does he think of getting?”</p>

<p>The question opened a flood-gate; and for
the next fifteen minutes, talk of pros and cons
regarding different high-class motors snapped
with an ever-increasing vivacity in the erstwhile
chamber of suffering.</p>

<p>Once Betsy came near the door and listened.</p>

<p>“But <i>that</i> car doesn’t have to be cranked,”
she heard her mistress declare in bright tones.</p>

<p>She nodded with satisfaction and ran upstairs
to put her belongings in a suit-case.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>BETSY’S APPEAL</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">True</span> to her promise, Betsy stayed but two
days in Boston, and Mrs. Bruce, having had
a very good time in her absence, was graciously
pleased to let bygones be bygones when she
returned.</p>

<p>“Was your shopping successful?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, we did real well,” was the reply. “I
didn’t know there was so many good ready-made
things folks could get.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce smiled leniently.</p>

<p>“Rather awful things,” she said, “but I
suppose they did very well for your friend
from the country.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she’ll look real good in ’em after she’s
fitted to a few alterations. Miss Maynard’s
been gettin’ some ready-made ones.”</p>

<p>“She has?” ejaculated Mrs. Bruce with interest.</p>

<p>“Yes; they showed ’em to me, some of ’em,
when I went to Mrs. Nixon’s; and they’re
elegant.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; with Miss Maynard’s pocket-book,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
one can find very good things; and since
they’re coming here for the rest of the season,
she doesn’t need much. You say Mrs. Nixon
wired for the rooms?”</p>

<p>“Yes, right off; and they think they’ll get
here Saturday.”</p>

<p>That evening Irving Bruce, descrying Betsy
stooping over her sweet-pea bed, joined her.</p>

<p>“How is Miss Vincent?” he inquired.</p>

<p>Betsy rose and regarded him.</p>

<p>“Set a spell,” he continued, drawing her
down upon a garden-seat.</p>

<p>“I haven’t got anything to tell you, Mr.
Irving.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” remarked the young man
easily. “Don’t you suppose I know that you
went to town to get clothes for somebody?
Mrs. Bruce told me that. Of course it was
Rosalie. Whose gift? Yours or Mr. Derwent’s?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Derwent’s,” responded Betsy after a
reluctant pause.</p>

<p>“I hope they are proper for the seashore.”</p>

<p>“They’re real simple, and pretty, and good;
just like her.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what you bought.”</p>

<p>Irving brought his sun-burned face close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
to Betsy’s and hung his hand over the back
of the seat close to her shoulder.</p>

<p>Betsy pressed her lips together.</p>

<p>“If you don’t I’ll hug you, and Mrs. Bruce
is up there on the piazza, looking.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Irving, behave yourself!”</p>

<p>Betsy essayed to rise, and was brought back
swiftly by the strong hand.</p>

<p>“I can see her in everything if you’ll just
describe it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Betsy reluctantly, casting a
glance toward the piazza, “we got her a black
lace.”</p>

<p>“Too old, I should think.”</p>

<p>“No, no, ’tain’t,” Betsy forgot her reluctance
in defense. “It’s sort o’ half low neck
and has fluffy things on it—real pretty.”</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>“A white lace one— Oh, she does look just
like an angel in it, Mr. Irving!”</p>

<p>The speaker suddenly remembered herself,
and her lips snapped together.</p>

<p>Irving frowned slightly. “Well, Mr. Derwent
is blowing himself.”</p>

<p>“He gave me five hundred dollars, Mr.
Irving, and told me to fit that child out!”
Betsy could not resist imparting her joyous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
news. “Oh,”—she heaved a long, eloquent
sigh,—“I’ve had one good time, I tell you!
I wanted to stay longer, but I promised Mrs.
Bruce; and the everyday things she can get
herself. She’s smart, and knows that the
plainest things look best on her; because the
Creator’s made her so she don’t need any
trimmin’ up. I went to Mrs. Nixon’s house,
and there they were dressin’ Miss Maynard
out of a bottomless purse; but I’ll match my
girl against her.”</p>

<p>Irving, attentive, watched the narrow face
glow.</p>

<p>“And where did you say Rosalie is living?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say,” replied Betsy with a return
of caution.</p>

<p>“Not at Mrs. Nixon’s, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess not. While I was examinin’
Miss Maynard’s finery, I was glad I didn’t
have a pain in my head so that they could see
my thoughts. If they’d known Mr. Derwent’s
money was buyin’ another girl’s outfit they’d
’a’ needed a smellin’ bottle. You know, Mr.
Irving, I thought perhaps Miss Maynard
comin’ into that fortune would ’a’ liked to help
Rosalie in some way. It really surprised me
’cause she didn’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“Miss Maynard’s head is in the clouds for
the present. Very likely when she comes to
earth she will be more interested in other
people.”</p>

<p>Betsy looked at the speaker affectionately.
“You always was a generous boy,” she said.
“Never could be hired to knock anybody.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to knock you, right off this seat,
if you don’t tell me without any beating about
the bush, where Rosalie Vincent is. I expect
to go to Boston in a few days. I might help
her choose her hats.”</p>

<p>Betsy’s eyes met his earnestly. “Now, look
here. You’ve been as good as gold ever since
we left the lake. You haven’t asked me a
question.”</p>

<p>“That’s why you ought to answer me now,
instantly.”</p>

<p>“I’m not goin’ to tell you.” Betsy spoke
deliberately. “Rosalie’s got to make her own
way in the world. Mr. Derwent knows that
outside appearances count for a lot in her line
o’ business, and he’s givin’ her this outfit, just
as he’d give a boy a little capital to start him.
She’s goin’ to try an experiment, and I ain’t
goin’ to say anything about it. It’s an idea
o’ my own, and if it turns out all right, I’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
believe my good angel put it into my head;
but if folks like you—young men—play the
fool, it won’t turn out well; and then I’ll know
it was a caper o’ my bad angel. You needn’t
scowl and look as if you’d eat up any other
man who looks at her. You’re the one o’ the
lot I’m most afraid of, and you’re very likely
to see her.”</p>

<p>Irving sprang to his feet as if he had been
shot.</p>

<p>“Betsy, have you—is it possible—” he
nearly choked in his excitement—“have you
found her some place on the stage—vaudeville?”</p>

<p>Miss Foster, after her first jump, swallowed,
and looked at him in exasperation.</p>

<p>“Will you sit down and not scare a body
into a fit?”</p>

<p>“Have you, I say!” he demanded fiercely.
“I’ll see Derwent to-night if he’s had anything
to do with this.”</p>

<p>“For the land’s sake, Irving Bruce, you’re
actin’ like a natural-born fool—but I love
you for it!” The gray eyes sparkled. “Sit
down on this bench.”</p>

<p>He obeyed, but his eyes still devoured her.</p>

<p>“I can’t leave Mrs. Bruce, can I? If Rosalie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
went on the stage I’d have to go with her,
wouldn’t I? Do act as if you had some common
sense.”</p>

<p>“You frightened me,” said Irving.</p>

<p>“Well, you nearly gave <i>me</i> heart disease.”</p>

<p>Irving did not smile. His expression made
it difficult for his companion to proceed; but
there was no time like the present. She seldom
had opportunity to talk with the young man
alone, and Robert was amusing his hostess on
the porch.</p>

<p>“As I said a minute ago, Mr. Irving, you’re
a generous boy, and always were. You’re
likely to see Rosalie Vincent sooner or later,
and you’ll be put to the test. You know in
your inmost heart that you don’t care a thing
about her except the way you would a pretty
picture, or statue, that you’d come across.
You don’t know her at all in the first place,
so any attention you pay her would be just
for your own selfish fun, and you’ve said so
much to me about her, that I’m afraid you
<i>will</i> seek her if you get the chance—just for
her beauty, poor child.”</p>

<p>Irving’s thoughts had flown back to the
canyon, and a train of memories stirred him.</p>

<p>“She will attract a great many besides me,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
he said. “If there’s ever any need of shielding
her, I sha’n’t stand aside, you may be sure.”</p>

<p>“You’re the only one she needs shielding
<i>from</i>, Mr. Irving.” Betsy spoke with slow,
gentle emphasis. “I tell Rosalie to be mejum,
but she don’t know <i>how</i>. It isn’t in her. I’d
feel meaner’n pusley to say this to you, if
’twan’t meaner not to. She’s set you up, the
way a girl will, in a special niche of her heart.
How she come to I can’t see, ’cause she never
talked with you more’n once or twice. She
don’t know that I notice this, but she’s shown
it a number o’ times the last two days. Now
she hasn’t had a chance yet to know men
worth knowin’; and if you happen to meet her
anywhere, and just treat her pleasant but
real formal, she’ll get over this fancy—it’s
all just a part of her poetry and the notions
she lives among all the time, in her own
thoughts. It don’t amount to anything, now;
but it could if you acted selfish. I told you
before that I love her, Mr. Irving. She hasn’t
got a person to take care of her but me. I’m
glad she’s a girl all out o’ the question for
you, because Mrs. Bruce would never think
she was good enough, and would make her
unhappy; and as long as she <i>is</i> out o’ the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
question I ain’t afraid to ask the son o’ your
father and mother, the two finest people I
ever knew in my life, to keep away from her;
not flatter her; not show her any attention.
She’s as modest as a daisy, and got no more
worldly experience than one. Lots o’ men
admire that kind a little while, and then tread
on it without even noticin’ that they have.”</p>

<p>Irving during this speech had sunk his hands
in his pockets, and his eyes were fixed on his
outstretched pumps. Betsy regarded him
anxiously through a moment of silence.</p>

<p>“Do you ever wish we were back in the
canyon?” he asked. “I do.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Irving!” she ejaculated. “I don’t
believe you’ve heard a word I’ve been saying.”</p>

<p>“I have; but I doubt most of it. You’re
in love with me yourself, Betsy. That’s what’s
the matter with you.”</p>

<p>“H’m. Perhaps I might be if I could forget
how cross you were when you were teethin’
and how you tore your clothes, and got all
stuck up with jam. Your mother trusted me
perfectly. Whenever I carried you to her and
said, ‘Please spank him, ma’am,’ she always
did it without a question.” Betsy’s tone was
vainglorious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>Irving threw back his head, and his ringing
laugh caused Mrs. Bruce to look wonderingly
down the garden.</p>

<p>“An absolute monarchy, eh?” he responded.
“And you have the habit so, you want to
tyrannize over me still?”</p>

<p>“Don’t leave me with the feelin’ that you
want to shirk out of it by foolin’,” pursued
Betsy, refusing to smile, and rising, conscious
of Mrs. Bruce’s gaze.</p>

<p>Irving rose also and threw his arm tenderly
around her thin shoulders as they moved
toward the house.</p>

<p>She tried to escape, but the gentle vise
held.</p>

<p>“You’ve made me feel very sentimental,
referring as you have to our past, Betsy,” he
said emotionally. “Know’st thou these verses,
beginning—</p>

<p class="center small">
“‘There is no friend like the old friend, who has shared our morning days’ (and teething nights!)”<br />
</p>

<p>“Please, Mr. Irving!”</p>

<p>With a desperate wriggle, Betsy escaped,
and moved swiftly around toward the back
door of the cottage.</p>

<p>“Did she refuse you?” called Nixie, as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
friend stretched portentously, and then came
on up the steps.</p>

<p>“Absolutely.”</p>

<p>“It must be a habit of hers,” remarked Mrs.
Bruce. “Captain Salter has been returning
to the charge for years, so I’ve heard lately.”</p>

<p>“Great work!” declared Nixie with zest.
“He looks like a sea-dog that can hold on.
I must have some fun with the great and only
Betsy.”</p>

<p>“If you do,” remarked Irving lazily, “I’ll
have some fun with you that will make you
an interesting invalid for the rest of the summer.”</p>

<p>“Highty-tighty!” exclaimed Nixie. “I believe
sonny is in earnest, Mrs. Bruce.”</p>

<p>“Doubtless,” she returned, with some bitterness.
“Betsy has a true knight.”</p>

<p>“I <i>am</i> in earnest,” said Irving quietly.
“Betsy’s private affairs are as much to be
respected as your mother’s. Hands off.”</p>

<p>“I spoke to her about the captain once,”
said Mrs. Bruce. “He’d been as much as
making love to her under my very eyes, and
I put some innocent question, but—” the
speaker shrugged her shoulders—“she snubbed
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“Quite right,” said Irving promptly.</p>

<p>“The man’s crazy,” declared Mrs. Bruce,
“if he thinks Betsy could be persuaded to
leave us, and go and drudge for him. Of course
that’s all he wants her for; and she <i>is</i> clever.
She knows it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t agree with you,” said Irving
mildly. “Old Hiram’s in love with her. To
his eyes she looks just the same as she did
when they went to school together.”</p>

<p>“He shall have her then!” ejaculated Nixie
enthusiastically. “I shall make it my pleasure,
in slight, unostentatious ways, to throw them
together.”</p>

<p>“Wretch!” exclaimed Mrs. Bruce. “Destroyer
of homes! Do you want to give me
nervous prostration?”</p>

<p>“Did you ever try to throw Betsy anywhere
she didn’t want to go?” inquired Irving.</p>

<p>“That’s my comfort,” groaned Mrs. Bruce.
“She looked at Captain Salter as if she could
eat him when he told us what he had named
the boat.”</p>

<p>Nixie laughed. “She’s a character, isn’t
she? I’m not far from in love with her myself.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>A RAINY EVENING</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> various and sundry hatchets which had
been brandished in the mental atmosphere
between the natural guardians of those two
heroes, Irving Bruce and Robert Nixon, were
all decently buried by the time the Yellowstone
party were about to be reunited at
Fairport.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce had quite the glow of a hostess
as she placed flowers in the rooms of the expected
ones; and Mrs. Nixon had invited the
Bruce household, of which her son was to continue
to be one, to dine with them at the inn
on the evening of their arrival.</p>

<p>They had a cosy corner of the dining-room
to themselves when the time came.</p>

<p>Helen Maynard looked charming in an
evening gown of pale pink chiffon. The quiet
little chrysalis familiar to their Yellowstone
stage had yielded up a butterfly upon which
Mrs. Nixon looked with pride as the work of
her hands, noting with satisfaction the admiring
curiosity in the eyes of the three men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Even Helen’s demureness was not proof
against the radiance of her content to-night
as they took their places at the table. She
was seated between the two young men,
whose coats of tan provoked much comment
from the newcomers.</p>

<p>When they had taken their places, Robert
looked about with his usual cheerfulness.</p>

<p>“All present or accounted for but Hebe,”
he declared. “It seems as if she ought to
materialize and bring us our soup.”</p>

<p>Irving gazed at him. “You saw nothing unfitting,
then, in that office for her?”</p>

<p>The speaker’s manner was always quiet, but
his boon companion recognized the tone.</p>

<p>“Brute of my heart!” ejaculated the latter,
“‘I would not live alway,’ but a little longer,
please! You’ll pardon the natural yearnings
of an affectionate nature. I can’t help missing
lovely Hebe.”</p>

<p>“There is a more familiar face than Miss
Vincent’s that we are missing,” said Helen.
She turned to Mrs. Bruce. “How is Clever
Betsy?”</p>

<p>“Very well indeed, thank you,” returned
that lady. “She is evidently more than grateful
to be on her native heath again. I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
I never knew Betsy in such good spirits as she
has shown the past week.”</p>

<p>“I noticed it in Boston,” said Helen.
“When she came to see us she seemed so
happy. She said the best part of any trip,
no matter how delightful, was getting home
again.”</p>

<p>While Helen Maynard spoke, she had a
habit of turning at short intervals to Mr. Derwent
as if to include him in all she said; and
such was his ability to understand her, that
his eyes sent her an acknowledgment even
when there was no occasion for him to speak.</p>

<p>This time, however, he did answer.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder at Betsy. I like the looks
of this place very much myself.”</p>

<p>“And the taste of it,” added Robert, eating
his soup with a seaman’s appetite. “This is
very good, for a hotel. For myself, I live in a
private family, and I pity you all. Mrs. Bruce
has a cook with whom I’m liable to elope.”</p>

<p>“I’ll show her off to you some day soon,”
said Mrs. Bruce graciously.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Betsy Foster was meanwhile enjoying the
unwonted sole possession of the cottage. While
she straightened the chaos in the young men’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
rooms, a smile was on her lips, and a light
of excitement burned in her eyes.</p>

<p>When all was neat within doors and she
had eaten her simple supper, she went out
on the veranda, and seating herself in the best
rocker, rocked, and hummed one of Robert’s
most abandoned two-steps.</p>

<p>While she was thus enjoying the <i>dolce far
niente</i> of her unobserved evening, a light rain
began to fall.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I’m sorry if it does rain,”
she murmured. “It’ll keep ’em in the house,
and I want ’em all to be there. I’m sure it’ll
please Mr. Derwent.”</p>

<p>While she thus reflected, a square-shouldered,
sturdy, masculine figure entered the
gate and came up the garden-path.</p>

<p>Betsy showed no surprise at his appearance.
The pleasant light continued in her eyes as
she arose.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Hiram?” she said, as he
came up the steps. “Take the big chair.”</p>

<p>“Well!”</p>

<p>The sea-blue gaze scrutinized her as the
guest’s hard hand held hers until she jerked
it away with decision.</p>

<p>“Take the big chair,” she repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ye’d rather give me that than your hand,
eh?” returned Hiram, and he seated himself
on the edge of the flexible wicker.</p>

<p>“Sit back, and take comfort,” said Betsy,
returning to her rocker.</p>

<p>Captain Salter obeyed, moving cautiously.</p>

<p>“Well, travelin’ does improve folks, they
say. I can see you’re improved, Betsy.”</p>

<p>“You thought there was need of it, did
you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I should think so! I knew the minute
I got your note this afternoon that you was
beginnin’ to get more reasonable. To have
you do somethin’ real decent like askin’ a feller
to come and see you, showed that you was
broadenin’ out, Betsy, broadenin’ out. Folks
all gone to the inn to dinner, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I thought it would be a good chance
for me to hear some o’ the town gossip.”</p>

<p>“’Tis. Real good. It’s all over Fairport
that you and me’s goin’ to be married this
fall.” Betsy stopped rocking. “The name o’
the boat kind o’ started it up—”</p>

<p>“You might have known it would, Hiram
Salter!” said Betsy accusingly.</p>

<p>“O’ course I did. What d’ye s’pose I named
her for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Twas a mean trick, Hiram!”</p>

<p>Captain Salter changed the blade of grass
he was chewing to the other side of his mouth.
“Why, certainly,” he responded. “Ye didn’t
s’pose I wouldn’t descend to mean tricks,
did ye? We heard even when we was goin’ to
school that all’s fair in love and war.”</p>

<p>She looked at him for a moment with a
baffled gaze, then she spoke.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe a word of it,” she said defiantly.
“Everybody that knows me knows I
ain’t ever goin’ to marry anybody. I wouldn’t
anyway now—after you namin’ the boat. Do
you s’pose I’d marry a man that shows right
out plain that he’s a tyrant?”</p>

<p>Captain Salter emitted a low rumbling
laugh, and sat quiet in his all-embracing chair.</p>

<p>“Tell me what’s doin’ in town,” asked
Betsy in a different tone. “How’s Mrs.
Pogram gettin’ along without Rosalie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s havin’ a fierce time. She no
sooner gets settled with somebody to help
her, than Loomis upsets everything with some
of his fool doin’s.”</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ to surprise you,” said Betsy,
slowly, “more’n you ever was surprised in
your life, Hiram.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“How so? Goin’ to marry me this evenin’?”</p>

<p>“I found Rosalie Vincent out in Yellowstone
Park.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! Ye don’t say so! By the way,
Betsy, I was glad o’ those sightly pictures you
sent me. Course I s’pose they’re all lies—just
advertisin’—”</p>

<p>“No, indeed!” exclaimed Betsy eagerly.
“You never saw anything so beautiful. I—”</p>

<p>“Yes,” interrupted Hiram, “I’ve got ’em
pinned up on the wall, and, come October,
you’ll tell me all about it evenin’s. I cal’late
what with Europe and all the globe-trottin’
you’ve done lately, I’m goin’ to have a wife
that’ll beat that She-Herod-Sady that told
the Arabian Nights, all holler; and what’s
more, you won’t ever be afraid ye’ll get yer
head cut off; so ye’ll be ahead of her, every
way.”</p>

<p>“Hiram,” said Betsy severely, “what do
you think o’ my findin’ Rosalie ’way out
there?”</p>

<p>“I think ’twas part of her good luck.”</p>

<p>“What good luck has the child ever had?”</p>

<p>“That, and all that come of it.”</p>

<p>Betsy stared, a little disappointed at her
admirer’s foreknowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“Has Mr. Irving told you—” she began.</p>

<p>“Irving hasn’t had a chance to tell me much.
That Nixie feller talks to beat the clapper of
a bell.”</p>

<p>“But you like him, don’t you, Hiram?
He’s an awful nice, kind boy.”</p>

<p>“I guess he will be when I get him trained,”
returned Hiram equably. “He’s beginnin’ to
understand that I’m the cap’n o’ the Betsy.”</p>

<p>“If you knew how disagreeable that sounds,
you’d never say it in my presence!”</p>

<p>Hiram lifted the sea-blue eyes, and fixed
hers with their gaze.</p>

<p>“That sentence has got more music in it,”
he declared slowly, “than any other in the
English language. I’ll be good to you, Betsy—as
good as a man knows how to be to a
woman. You’ve taken care o’ folks for the
last twenty years. I want the job o’ takin’
care o’ you the next twenty.”</p>

<p>He looked very manly as he said it, his
strong figure leaning square shoulders toward
her. A swift vision chased through her brain
of her precious boy henceforth busy in the
bank by day, and in society by night; of Mrs.
Bruce’s increasing querulousness and exactions,
stretching out into an indefinite future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain’s fireside, and herself mistress
of his hearth and home, suddenly showed with
an attraction she had never felt before; as if it
were a haven of shelter from that monotonous
other future, with its stern sense of duty, and
its occasional high-lights.</p>

<p>“I believe you cal’late to tire me out,
Hiram.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder,” he returned, leaning
back again and biting his blade of grass.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ask me about Rosalie?”
said Betsy. “What do you know?”</p>

<p>“Why, Irving told me that you found her
out there, and wheedled some old gent into
payin’ her way back East again, and that she
was in Boston now, and that you’re keepin’
an eye on her.”</p>

<p>“Old gentleman!” repeated Betsy indignantly.
“If you call yourself one, then he is.
He’s just about your age.”</p>

<p>“I’m just the right age to be a bridegroom,”
responded Captain Salter promptly.</p>

<p>“I hope Mr. Irving didn’t say anything
about this before Mr. Nixon. It’s a secret.”</p>

<p>“No. He got a chance at me alone while we
was mendin’ a sail. He told me mum was the
word. I’ll bet a cookie, Betsy, that now you’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
got Rosalie in Boston you don’t know what
to do with her.”</p>

<p>Betsy gave her one-sided smile, and Hiram
continued: “Irving says you think a sight o’
the girl; and I’ve been sort o’ cogitatin’ about
the whole business; and I finally made up my
mind to tell ye that if ye want her to live with
<i>us</i>, I haven’t a mite of objection.”</p>

<p>The speaker could see by his lady-love’s
countenance that this bait glittered.</p>

<p>“I <i>had</i> thought, Hiram,” she returned ingratiatingly,
“that seein’ you and Rosalie are
such good friends, you might let Mrs. Bachelder
move over to your place; then Rosalie could
go there.”</p>

<p>Captain Salter gave his rare, broad smile.</p>

<p>“My! but you’re a good planner, ain’t
you!”</p>

<p>“Would you—would you think of it,
Hiram?” she asked, with some timidity.</p>

<p>“Not if I wanted to keep real well, I
wouldn’t. Now don’t waste time in foolishness,
Betsy. I’ve ben gettin’ ready for ye for years,
and I <i>am</i> ready. Everything’s taut and ship-shape,
and I’ve got a margin that’ll let
Rosalie in, easy. We’ll be as cosy as bugs in
rugs next winter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Salter was an experienced fisherman.
The expression on Betsy’s face was such that
he believed the bait was swallowed.</p>

<p>“If obstinacy would get folks into the
kingdom,” she observed, “your chances for
bein’ an archangel would be real good, Hiram
Salter.”</p>

<p>He let the reel spin, and the coveted fish dart
away with the line.</p>

<p>“I always did hang onto an idea like a
puppy to a root,” he said. “It’s kind o’ ingrained
in my nature; but you’ll know best,
Betsy. You’ve got to be ’tarnally unselfish to
somebody in order to be happy; and you think
it over. See if ’tain’t about time you changed
the place and kept the pain.”</p>

<p>He rose, and Betsy did also. For a wonder
she didn’t answer him.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” he said. “It was real clever
of you to let me come this evenin’.”</p>

<p>He did not even take her hand at parting.
He lifted the shabby yachting-cap and looked
at her narrow, inscrutable face. “Good-night,”
he said again, and was gone down the garden-path.</p>

<p>Betsy remained some minutes standing in
the same position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“I meant to ask him a hundred questions.”
The reflection rose at last from the confusion
of her thoughts. “He’s such a gump it makes
it hard to talk to him; keeps goin’ back to say
the same thing over and over, just like a poll-parrot,
till he puts me out so I don’t know
what I <i>did</i> want to say to him.”</p>

<p>As she went into the cottage, the picture of
the upright figure, and the clean, bronzed,
weather-beaten face went with her.</p>

<p>The appealing blue of Rosalie’s eyes seemed
to plead with her. “Oh, if I only knew how
she’s gettin’ along!” thought Betsy.</p>

<p>Captain Salter was right to smile into the
darkness as he plodded down the street. The
fish was darting here and there through the
unresisting water after its fright, still proudly
conscious of its own volition; but the bait was
swallowed. The fisherman believed it was a
matter of time, now.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>THE WHITE DOVE</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> dinner-party at the inn continued to be
a merry one.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry it rains,” said Mrs. Bruce,
looking at the dewy panes when at last they
rose from table. “I wanted you to see how
pleasant the outlook is from the verandas.”</p>

<p>The proprietor passed near them as they
moved into the spacious living-room of the inn.</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t you have a pleasant evening
for us, Mr. Beebe?” asked Mrs. Bruce.</p>

<p>“Sorry I couldn’t,” he returned. “I’m
goin’ to make up for it the best I can, though.
I’ve got an entertainment for you if you’ll
take your friends to that other end o’ the
room.”</p>

<p>“Music!” groaned Irving. “I feel in my
bones that somebody is going to sing. Us for
the porch, Nixie.”</p>

<p>This party had been last to leave the dining-room,
and already a large group of guests had
gathered in the living-room, and were waiting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Irving was already taking long, quiet strides
away from the scene of danger when Robert
caught him by the arm.</p>

<p>“Heavens, Brute!” he gasped. “Look
there! <i>Is</i> it—or isn’t it!”</p>

<p>Irving turned, and beheld at the other end
of the room Rosalie Vincent, dressed in white,
standing quietly, looking about her and
smiling a little as if in question of her audience,
and wondering what she should do for them.</p>

<p>Irving’s heart gave the most acrobatic
bound of its existence. He stood fixed in his
tracks.</p>

<p>“Do you see who that is, mother?” inquired
Robert, leaning over the ladies.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce’s busy eyes sought her lorgnette.</p>

<p>Helen Maynard was first to realize who it
was that stood there tall and fair in the
fleecy white gown, with the golden coronet
of her hair shining as her only ornament, and
her bare throat and arms, round and slender
against a dark background.</p>

<p>“Most extraordinary!” exclaimed Mrs.
Nixon. “I never saw such a resemblance.”</p>

<p>She looked over at her brother in a neighboring
chair. He was smoothing his mustache;
and he nodded at her in reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, it <i>is</i> Hebe!” declared Robert,
and his voice cracked high. “I never saw
anything so lovely in my life.”</p>

<p>“<i>How</i> did it happen?” inquired Mrs.
Bruce. She looked at Irving. His face was
tense and scowling. “Tell me, Irving,” she
demanded in low tones. “How in the world
did she get here?”</p>

<p>“How should I know?” he returned; and
so irefully that Mrs. Bruce stared at him.
Why in the world should it make him angry?</p>

<p>Irving’s heart kept on its quickened pace.
So this was what Betsy meant by saying he was
likely to see her; why she had adjured him to
keep away from her. She had said—Irving’s
eyes devoured the white dove; but Rosalie
began to speak, and again her voice was music.</p>

<p>“I scarcely know what you would like to
hear this rainy evening,” she said, “but I
think I will begin by going back to first principles,
and telling you the story of Red Riding
Hood.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce’s lips would scarcely meet.</p>

<p>“What self-possession!” she murmured;
and then for a time all speculation ceased, for
the voice of a child began to narrate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
classic in the language of a child, and Rosalie
carried her audience with her. The little unobserved
details of the infantile manner, its
occasional abstractions and recalls to the
subject, the catching of the breath, and a
myriad other peculiarities, were all in evidence,
and repeated laughter encouraged the
story-teller.</p>

<p>Her big-eyed wonder and horror when she
arrived at the thrilling crisis where the wolf
devoured Red Riding Hood’s grandmother,
“before she even had time to put on her
spectacles to see who it was ate her up,”
brought down the house; and when the tale
drew to a close the clamor of tongues gave
witness that Rosalie was a success.</p>

<p>“Isn’t she sweet!”—“Did you <i>ever</i> hear
anything so natural!” sped from mouth to
mouth. “What a lovely creature she is, and so
unaffected!”</p>

<p>And Rosalie stood there looking about,
unconsciously smiling, and tingling to her
finger-tips with gladness that she had not
disappointed Mr. Derwent, whom she could
see sitting at the other end of the room.</p>

<p>Mr. Beebe came laughingly to Mrs. Bruce
as a Fairport summer oracle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, ain’t she all right?” he demanded
triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Where—” asked Mrs. Bruce, stammering
in her eagerness, “how did you happen to get
her?”</p>

<p>“’Twas Clever Betsy’s doings. Didn’t
she tell you? Seems Miss Vincent wanted a
job o’ this kind for the summer, and Betsy
thought she’d work me; and I’m mighty glad
she did. The girl is onto her job. There, she’s
goin’ to give another.”</p>

<p>The speaker hurried off, while Rosalie’s
sweet voice began on one of the Riley favorites
that bring tears as well as smiles.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce did not hear a word. She leaned
back in her chair, a prey to conflicting emotions.
She saw Mr. Derwent rise and change
his position to one in the background of those
who were closest to the speaker.</p>

<p>Robert Nixon stooped close to her ear.
“You can’t lose the Yellowstone party,” he
said, “and aren’t you the proud lady!”</p>

<p>It was an innocent speech on the part of the
irresponsible Nixie, but it started the regulating
of Mrs. Bruce’s confused thoughts. She
realized that he was referring to the perspicacity
with which she had recognized Rosalie’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
gifts in an unpromising past, and the munificence
with which she had cultivated them;
so she sat on a fence, as it were, undecided on
which side to get down.</p>

<p>She viewed the faces of the absorbed listeners,
and considered that she might indeed
accept the part of complacent patroness of
this young heroine of the evening; might ask
no questions, raise no objections, and behave
as though this were the natural and expected
outcome of her own perception and generosity;
but her irritable vanity and love of managing
whispered loudly that she had been outwitted.</p>

<p>Who had loosed Rosalie from the engagement
in the Park? Who had paid her transportation
east? Who had housed her since?
Who had procured the dainty gown in which
she now stood, and doubtless a trunk-full
more if she were to live and entertain in this
inn, as Mr. Beebe had plainly stated was the
case? He had also plainly stated the answer
to these various phases of one conundrum.
Betsy it was, of course! For whom else had
the clever one deserted her post of duty and
gone to Boston to help a friend from the country
to buy clothes? Did she really suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
that Mrs. Bruce was too dense to see completely
through this millstone?</p>

<p>Yes, it was plain. The savings of a lifetime
had been squandered by Betsy Foster,
who must be in her dotage to have done such
a thing; squandered on this blonde girl with
the appealing, darkening eyes, who was this
minute swaying her listeners to smiles and
tears.</p>

<p>By this time Mrs. Bruce had decided on
which side of the fence to get down, and she
did so with energy; and glared across it at
Rosalie and her poor dupe, the once clever
Betsy.</p>

<p>To think of Betsy being such a traitor as not
to ask her mistress’s advice, seeing that this
was Mrs. Bruce’s affair, and she would be the
best judge of what was right to do!</p>

<p>The offended woman glanced again at her
son. Rosalie had not driven the unconscious
frown from his tense face.</p>

<p>“I’m sure he suspects the same thing,” she
reflected. “He is so loyal to Betsy, he will be
outraged.”</p>

<p>Helen Maynard was another who heard as
little of Rosalie’s recitation as Mrs. Bruce.
Her mental questions were the same. Whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
magic wand could have accomplished this
transformation in the short time?</p>

<p>A cloud had descended on the heiress’s
evening. She remembered the questions Irving
Bruce had put to her in the Look-Out at Old
Faithful Inn. She knew then that he was
trying to probe her interest in her unfortunate
school friend, and she remembered the hard
obstinacy that at that time rose in her heart
against Rosalie. Why, before she had had
time to find herself in her new situation,
should she begin to take care of and plan for
another girl? Her first suspicion and her first
look when she recognized Rosalie this evening
had been directed toward Irving Bruce; but
if his amazement were not unfeigned, he was
more capable in histrionics than Rosalie herself.</p>

<p>It was a Saturday evening, and the week-end
influx of men had given Proprietor Beebe an
extra satisfaction in the presentation of a
successful novelty on this rainy night.</p>

<p>Irving Bruce watched the faces of the men,
some of whom he knew, and others not, and
glared upon all alike because of the open
admiration in their eyes for his white dove—more
and more his, with every comment that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
he saw being made upon her; with every ring
of applause bestowed upon her efforts to
please.</p>

<p>He knew what would happen when this was
over. Men as well as women would press
upon the young girl to thank her, and he knew
with what modest gratitude Rosalie would
accept their tributes. He could see Mr. Beebe
going about on the outskirts of the crowd,
proud of her beauty and success, and knew
that he would introduce to her anybody who
asked it.</p>

<p>Irving drew near to Mrs. Bruce’s chair and
stooped over.</p>

<p>“Join her when this is over, will you,
Madama? I don’t believe she has any chaperon.”</p>

<p>“No, I thank you,” was the clear response.
“I think I never saw any one who required it
less.”</p>

<p>Irving bit his lip. “Don’t speak that way,”
he begged. “You know they’ll begin dancing
after this. Beebe will make it possible for
every Tom, Dick, and Harry to dance with
her.”</p>

<p>“Which will be very much to her taste, I
imagine,” retorted Mrs. Bruce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Helen Maynard heard the whispered colloquy.
She knew that if, at the close of
Rosalie’s efforts, she herself should go forward
and join the girl, stand beside her, put her on
a par with the guests, Irving Bruce would
never forget it of her.</p>

<p>She leaned back in her chair, her heart
beating a little fast. By nature she loved
power. She had begun to taste it to-night.
Aware of looking her best, aware of the sunshine;
of approval rained upon her by Mrs.
Nixon and Mrs. Bruce, and the frank admiration
of the young men, there was a still sweeter
triumph for her in the expression of Mr. Derwent’s
eyes, which roved over her faint rose-color
with an amused kindness at first, but
lingered with a surprise and admiration
which she treasured eagerly. Suddenly all was
changed. There was a centre of attraction
toward which all eyes gravitated. Mr. Derwent
had risen and left their party to go
nearer. Irving Bruce believed that Rosalie
needed protection from a too violent belle-ship.
Should she go across this room, and
stand as a sort of maid-of-honor to this white
and gold pauper princess?</p>

<p>Nixie leaned over her chair. Again his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
random words hit the mark and might carry
the day.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he whispered to Helen, “you
two girls will look stunning together. You
must let me take you over there as soon as
Hebe gets through.”</p>

<p>Helen’s lips compressed and she did not
reply.</p>

<p>Rosalie was about to give her last recitation.
It was a tender sketch, but with plenty
of comedy.</p>

<p>A mother was rocking her baby and singing
him to sleep, with periodic interruptions from
her other children whom she dismissed with
varying manner and replies.</p>

<p>It was excellently done. Rosalie’s singing
was simple and natural, her voice sympathetic,
and when the lullaby finally died away, and
she rose and bent her lovely head above the
baby as she laid him in an imaginary bed,
there were plenty of dim eyes among her auditors.</p>

<p>The absolute stillness broke as the girl rose
and smiled again upon her listeners,—the
modest, deprecatory smile the Yellowstone
party knew so well.</p>

<p>Irving’s eyes shone. “Mrs. Nixon,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
he to that lady, “may I take you over to
speak to Miss Vincent? She is in strange surroundings
and will appreciate it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Mrs. Nixon with a surprised
and regal lift of the head, “the girl
certainly does charming work. I’m quite
willing to tell her so.”</p>

<p>She rose and took Irving’s offered arm,
and they moved away. Mrs. Bruce held her
lip between her teeth; her face burned, her
eyes filled with tears of anger and mortification.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” ejaculated Robert, still
winking hard, “that girl made my nose tingle.
She has one of these silly voices, you know,
that go way in and knock on your heart, and
if you try to steel yourself, it just opens the
door and walks in any way. Come on, let’s all
three go over and tell her she’s a dandy.
Look at ’em crowd around her! She’s like a
drop of honey in fly-time.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce and Helen rose undecidedly.</p>

<p>“Say, look at Uncle Henry!” exclaimed
Robert with a joyous squeak. “Isn’t he
Johnny-on-the-spot though? Those chaps
aren’t going to have it all their own way.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce pressed her handkerchief to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
lips, for she too saw Mr. Derwent move a little
in advance of the other guests, and after
holding Rosalie’s hand a moment in congratulation,
draw it within his arm and stand
beside her while the kindly, effusive crowd
drew near.</p>

<p>Helen Maynard shrugged her shoulders.
“That settles it, Mrs. Bruce,” she said. “Mr.
Derwent has evidently decided to make her a
success. Very nice for her, isn’t it? We may
as well go and speak to her, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce moved with them in silence.
Robert glanced at her with comprehension.</p>

<p>“Darn Brute,” he thought. “Why did he
want to go and get mother in wrong here!”
To his simple mind it was difficult to grasp
the mental processes of his hostess; but he saw
her emotion. “I’ll chance a jolly, anyway,”
he reflected.</p>

<p>“You must feel like a lady Columbus,” he
said to Mrs. Bruce, with an admiring air.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Nixie,” she rejoined. “I feel like
a cipher. Nothing more.”</p>

<p>In his whole life Irving had never slighted
her before. For that girl’s sake he had not
hesitated to punish her. This was Betsy’s
doing,—all her doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>So the waves of heat and hurt passed over
her as she crossed the room on Nixie’s arm,
seeing, ahead of her, Irving devotedly talking
to Mrs. Nixon as they moved toward the star
of the evening.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>THE DANCE</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">With</span> the approval of her audience ringing
in her ears, and Mr. Derwent’s kindly presence
and support to bridge over the awkward first
moments that assail the drawing-room entertainer
when her work is done, Rosalie might
scarcely have been able to keep her slender
white slippers touching earth but for an anchor,
a ball and chain, which Betsy had in all
kindness attached to her on the last evening
they spent together.</p>

<p>They had sat on the edge of the bed in their
boarding-house, talking, and Betsy plunged
boldly into a subject that lay heavy on her
heart.</p>

<p>“I feel just as certain as I sit here,” she
said, “that you’re goin’ to make a success of
it at that inn.”</p>

<p>“O Betsy,—” the young girl took her
friend’s hand joyously,—“I like to hear you
say so, and I do really believe I can please
them because I love to do it so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ve showed me a lot o’ your pieces,
and it’s a sensible selection. You ain’t goin’
to tear up the ground and try to be a Burnhard.
You’re goin’ to make ’em laugh, and
if they’re as soft as I am, you’re goin’ to
make ’em cry, same as you have me to-night.
That’s where you’ve got good judgment.
You’ve got as sweet a voice as I ever heard,
and your glass tells you you’re good-lookin’.”</p>

<p>The girl leaned toward her eagerly. “Do you
think I’m very pretty, Betsy?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; and it’s a good thing for your work;
but listen here, Rosalie, it ain’t a good thing
for anything else.”</p>

<p>The girl laughed. “You silly, dear Betsy!”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Mr. Irving was talkin’ about somebody in
your line o’ work lately; and I listened hard on
your account. He said she wa’n’t any good—her
programmes wasn’t. He said she didn’t
have ‘the instinct of the entertainer’! Those
were his very words. I said ’em over to myself
so’s to remember; for I saw his point.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he’ll believe that I have?”
The girl’s azure eyes darkened as she asked it.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do. The way you’ve made me act
silly to-night, shows that you know how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
make folks laugh while they’re cryin’; and
that’s as near the secret o’ success as any one
can come, I guess; but it ain’t goin’ to be all
roses, dear child.” Betsy patted the hand
that held hers. It was hard for her to dim
the blue light shining upon her so hopefully.
“I said your good looks were a disadvantage,
and they are from the minute you stop actin’.
We happened to speak of Mr. Irving just
now, so I’ll take him for an example. He’s
the apple o’ my eye, Rosalie, and I believe in
him just as much as I do in any man, as far
as intentions go; but he’ll be one of a whole
lot o’ young men you’ll meet at the inn, and
you’re a little bit acquainted with him, and
he’s sure to enjoy your work, and your good
looks, and he’s liable to flatter you, and when
the summer’s over—”</p>

<p>Betsy could scarcely go on, the expression
of the blue eyes was changing so fast as their
gaze clung to her; but she braced herself.</p>

<p>“<i>That’ll</i> be over, too. Men-folks are selfish.
They don’t know what they’re doin’. Irving
Bruce has inherited quite a lot o’ money.
He knows dozens o’ the finest girls in Boston.
Mrs. Bruce probably expects that some
crown princess from the other side o’ the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
water’ll be over here after him yet. Have a
good time, Rosalie,” Betsy again patted the
relaxed hand, which she could feel tremble,
“but be mejum. I speak this way to you because
I know your disposition, and your unhappiness
would cut me deep.”</p>

<p>The girl withdrew her hand quietly. “Thank
you,” she said.</p>

<p>“Old Kill-joy that I am!” thought poor
Betsy as she lay awake that night, and knew
that Rosalie was awake beside her; but the
very effect of her words convinced her that
it was necessary to have spoken them; and
when she supplemented this by her appeal to
Irving later in the garden, she felt that she had
done her worst, and her best; and whatever
came, her conscience was clear.</p>

<p>As Rosalie stood in the living-room of the inn
to-night, her hand within Mr. Derwent’s arm,
she was too excited to be conscious that it was
his action which heightened the effusiveness
of the guests. They might laugh and weep
under her efforts to entertain them, but many
who would not have taken her hand afterward
advanced graciously when it was quickly
whispered that the man beside her was Henry
Derwent of Boston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your brother is a trump!” murmured
Irving to Mrs. Nixon.</p>

<p>The lady looked resigned.</p>

<p>“When Henry takes it into his head to
befriend any one,” she said, “he carries his
point. Since the day he found, out there in the
Park, that this girl was the daughter of his old
friend, I suppose he has never really forgotten
her. It is like him to be so rejoiced in this
change in her fortunes that he immediately
takes her under his wing.”</p>

<p>“He’s a trump!” repeated Irving.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon was dimly aware that Mrs.
Bruce would be fuming at her action, for she
had overheard her refusal of Irving’s request.</p>

<p>“I can’t do otherwise than stand by my
brother,” thought Mrs. Nixon. “I can’t help
it if she is offended.”</p>

<p>And now they had reached Rosalie, and for
the first time Irving noticed that she was very
pale.</p>

<p>He had counted on a special look from
those blue eyes,—a look that would recall
the last time they had stood together, in a
world of beauty created for them alone.</p>

<p>He heard Mrs. Nixon say in her grave,
sonorous tones:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your work is charming!”</p>

<p>And yet he had not caught her eye.</p>

<p>Betsy had said—fond, foolish Betsy! who
could suppose that she would be so imaginative,
Betsy had said—and the expression and
manner with which Rosalie now turned to
him at last, gave the lie direct to all those
implications.</p>

<p>“Good-evening, Mr. Bruce. How tanned
you are!” the girl said, raising her eyebrows
with a little smile, as if they had met yesterday
on Tremont Street.</p>

<p>Then she turned to meet a couple of young
men who pressed forward under the guidance
of Mr. Beebe.</p>

<p>“These gentlemen are anxious to meet you,
Miss Vincent, and say some pretty things.
Mr. Ames and Mr. Foster, Miss Vincent, and
Mr. Derwent, too.”</p>

<p>Mr. Derwent inclined his head, his hand
hanging by his side, and Rosalie’s tightened
on his arm as she turned from Irving to meet
the somewhat embarrassed expressions of enthusiasm
from the young men, who seemed to
find Rosalie’s immobile and white-mustached
companion somewhat of a bar to their loquacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hope to see you again, Miss Vincent,
when the dancing begins,” said Mr. Ames as
they withdrew.</p>

<p>Now came Robert and his companions.</p>

<p>“Dancing?” repeated Robert in a high key.
“Anybody taken your first waltz, Miss Vincent?”
Rosalie shook her head.</p>

<p>“Mine, then. Is it?”</p>

<p>“If you wish,” said the girl, and then took
Mrs. Bruce’s mechanically offered hand.</p>

<p>This lady had keyed herself to one master-effort,
and she said now:—</p>

<p>“You know, I always believed you could.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, Mrs. Bruce!”</p>

<p>Rosalie’s smile of gratitude, her low tone,
and the sudden moisture that dimmed her
eyes, should have touched the heart of her
benefactress; but that organ could not hold
another emotion. Mrs. Bruce slightly bowed
and smiled, and moved slowly away.</p>

<p>At Robert Nixon’s invitation to Rosalie,
Helen bit her lip. “Rude,—incredibly rude
cub!” she thought. “I’ll never forgive him
for that!”</p>

<p>The clinging of Rosalie to Mr. Derwent’s
arm was another item in her disfavor; and
Helen approached, her habitual self-control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
standing her in good stead, but all the rose-color
of the opening of her evening turned to
ashes of roses.</p>

<p>“I had no idea you were so proficient, Miss
Vincent,” she said calmly. “Why haven’t
you gone into this long ago?”</p>

<p>Rosalie met her cool regard admiringly.</p>

<p>“Things have changed for us both wonderfully
since we met in the Park,” she said.
“You look very lovely to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, really?” Helen gave a little laugh
and quietly met Mr. Derwent’s eyes. “How
kind!”</p>

<p>“Me next,” said Robert. “We’ll have to
beat it in a minute, ’cause there are a lot more
coming; but I want to tell you you’re a wonder.
My nose felt like your foot when it’s asleep,
and a pearly tear coursed down my rounded
cheek—”</p>

<p>Here the speaker was pushed aside, and
found it best to skip after Helen’s pink robe.</p>

<p>“Brute says this floor’s all right when the
minions get the rugs up,” he said, as he joined
her. “They don’t have any cards here, but
you’ll give me the—yes, the second dance,
won’t you—and the—yes, I remember you
dance like a fairy. You must give me a lot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert ended in a rush of crimson embarrassment
as Helen moved steadily onward toward
the corner where Mrs. Nixon had taken a
seat.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she returned. “It is fortunate
for me that you dance as well as you do
other things; because after all, I’m a stranger
here, you know, and beggars mustn’t be
choosers.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon received the pair with a smile.
“Well, my dears,” she said, “we’ve all done
our duty, haven’t we?”</p>

<p>“<i>Pourvu seulement</i> she doesn’t tell mamma,”
thought Robert with a sinking of the heart.</p>

<p>“Haven’t we?” he responded airily. “And
look at my noble uncle—I’m not quite sure
whether his name is Quixote or Casabianca;
but I hope he’ll get off the rug soon, so it can
be taken up.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” responded Mrs. Nixon graciously.
“I’m glad there’s to be dancing, for I may
be a fond mamma, but I do think when you
and dear Helen dance, that the poetry of motion
is reached. Where has Mrs. Bruce disappeared
to?”</p>

<p>“Never end your sentences with a preposition,
mother! But despite your inelegance I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
will go and find her for you;” and Robert
moved away, his eager eyes searching, but
not for Irving’s stepmother. He soon descried
the tall outline of his friend, standing alone
in the dusk of the veranda, and he charged
upon him.</p>

<p>“Brute, I’ve put my foot in it!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p>Irving turned slowly and regarded him.</p>

<p>“That’s all you ever take it out for, so far
as I can discover,” he replied pessimistically.</p>

<p>“Cruelly unjust, but I’ll pass it by. Say,
there aren’t so many peaches here but that
you can do me a favor.”</p>

<p>“Say on.”</p>

<p>Robert made a grimace of rueful self-disgust.</p>

<p>“Of course I ought to have taken the first
dance with Helen Maynard.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t do anything else.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I could. I can always do things that
to others would seem impossible. To me
they’re mere bagatelles. I’m about to be
snubbed evermore by the heiress, and disinherited
by mother.”</p>

<p>“Speak out.”</p>

<p>“It was an attack of emotional insanity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
They always come out of a clear sky, and she
was <i>so</i> enchanting—”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Hebe. I asked her for the first dance,
in Helen’s presence.”</p>

<p>Irving looked the culprit over from head
to foot.</p>

<p>“Well,” he remarked, with a severity which
seemed disproportionate to the occasion, “you
<i>are</i> the limit!”</p>

<p>“And a transfer!” added Robert humbly.
“Now you’re the only person that can save
the day—I mean the evening. If you’ll go
in, this minute,—go in eagerly, you know,
just as soon as she sees you, fall over your own
feet in your hurry,—do the thing handsomely,
why, you’ll be acting like a friend! Get your
breath as well as you can, and ask her for the
first dance. So you will avert the storm from
your tried and true Nixie!”</p>

<p>Irving looked unpromisingly gloomy. “I
wasn’t thinking of dancing to-night,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, think of it quick, now.” Robert
dragged at his reluctant companion. “Put
on a gilt edge by asking for the second one,
too. She can’t give it to you, because I’ve
engaged it. When you see me in the light,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
you’ll think I’ve turned gray in a single
night; but it’s only the frosty rime that she
cast over me when she accepted. Beside,
you’ve got to ask Miss Vincent, haven’t you?
You seem to have in<i>flu</i>ence with mamma, and
I’d rather you’d bring her over to be chaperoned
than do it myself. Uncle Henry can’t
play watchdog very well when it comes to
partners.”</p>

<p>Irving allowed himself to be shoved and
pulled toward the door. He felt the force of
Nixie’s last argument, but he was still conscious
of a strange disappointment in the carelessness
of Rosalie’s greeting. Betsy’s earnest
talk had fallen upon a wondering credulity,
because of the tenderness that he had felt for
this girl from the beginning,—a feeling totally
different from anything he had ever experienced.</p>

<p>Her self-possession, and fleeting notice of
himself just now, had given him an odd shock,
and opened his eyes to the fact that he had
given absurd weight to Betsy’s words.</p>

<p>Now, under Robert’s vigorous appeal, he
shook himself together.</p>

<p>“I’m a worse sentimental idiot than dear
old Betsy,” he thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert, lurking cautiously in the background,
viewed his friend’s deliberate advance
to Mrs. Nixon’s corner, and heaved a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>Slinking into the hall with intent to seek
Rosalie, he saw her, still leaning on the arm
of Mr. Derwent, who was leading her, also,
toward the corner where Mrs. Nixon sat enthroned.
Robert remained unostentatiously
behind the jamb of the door, and his small
bright eyes twinkled appreciatively as he
watched his uncle place a chair near by for
his charge.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bruce has slid out of it,” he thought
gleefully, “and mamma is Hebe’s chaperon,
willy-nilly. I’ll bet she don’t like it a little bit!
Now, Nixie, look bland and don’t let your
upper lip wiggle. You may pull it off yet!”</p>

<p>The rugs had been swiftly removed, and the
music started. A number of couples swung
promptly out upon the floor.</p>

<p>Robert saw Irving say something to Rosalie,
and then smile and bow to Helen, who rose and
floated away with him.</p>

<p>Then, only, Robert, with an expression of
singular innocence, came leisurely across the
floor to his mother’s corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked at him with a fixed regard, and
her nostrils dilated.</p>

<p>“Where were you, Robert?” she asked.
“Irving has taken Helen out for the first
dance.”</p>

<p>“Just like him,” returned Robert brazenly.
“Mother, you must accustom yourself to such
blows, or your parental pride will be constantly
wounded. I’m not one, two, three with Brute
where girls are concerned, but I’ve had to
learn to turn a sunny side to the world in spite
of it, and weep only when alone. I don’t
want to grow cynical, but I find that it is too
true that others care little for our sorrows.
Miss Vincent, shall we show them how to do
this?”</p>

<p>Rosalie rose, smiling a farewell to Mr.
Derwent, and started off in such perfect step
with her partner that he emitted a joyous
exclamation.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Hebe isn’t some dancer!” he
said. “Say, do you mind my calling you
Hebe? It takes so much less time than Terpsichore.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Nixon, your mother didn’t like this
at all,” said Rosalie.</p>

<p>“Well, when you come right down to it,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
remarked her partner philosophically, “there
are so few things she does like.”</p>

<p>“But—ought you not to have had this
with Miss Maynard?”</p>

<p>“Some carping critics might say so,—Look
out, there! Didn’t we duck neatly
under Brute’s elbow? The fact is, Miss Vincent,
I’ve graduated in almost every line
except diplomacy; and <i>you</i>—you just swept
me off my feet to-night. No—don’t be
afraid I shall try to flirt with you. That requires
diplomacy, too, and I make too many
breaks ever to be successful at it. I was crazy
about you to-night, and when I heard Ames
say ‘dancing,’ I blurted my innocent wish
right out. I’m just a child of nature—fresh,
unspoiled.”</p>

<p>Rosalie laughed. “I’ve heard people say
you were fresh,” she said.</p>

<p>“Naughty, naughty!” returned Robert.</p>

<p>“No, you’re the naughty one,” said the
girl. “You’ve put me in a disagreeable position.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it, Hebe. I know you are
enjoying this.”</p>

<p>She sighed. “You do dance like a—a
ribbon,” she admitted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert laughed.</p>

<p>“And what has Helen to complain of?” he
asked. “Hasn’t she the great and only Brute?
I’m making the most of your approval of my
dancing before you try it with him. He is one
of these haughty heroes, who h-excel in everything,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Including flirting, I suppose,” said Rosalie.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t say. He’s never flirted with me.
Humble observation, however, would deduce
that all he ever does is to allow himself to be
made love to.”</p>

<p>Rosalie swallowed, and essayed a laugh.</p>

<p>“Companionship with Brute has made
me a socialist, socially, Hebe. Here I am,
cheerful, willing to please—average good-looking.
Yes, I maintain it. Now, Hebe, am
I not average good-looking? Don’t speak too
quickly. Remember, Chinese, African, American-Indian—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Nixon,”—Rosalie did laugh
now,—“how can you talk so constantly, and
dance too?”</p>

<p>They were passing Mrs. Nixon, and that
lady heard the girlish laugh. She sighed.</p>

<p>“She certainly dances well. Helen said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
she was noted for it at school. I suppose she
is a really artistic creature; but Robert should
have been here in time to ask Helen. College
has absolutely ruined his manners.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Nixon leaned toward her brother, who
was watching his <i>protégée</i>, pleased in her pleasure.</p>

<p>“Where can Mrs. Bruce be?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was the reply. “I suppose
she has many friends here.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Nixon doubted if sociability were
keeping her friend away.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid she’s pouting somewhere,” she
reflected. “I don’t see how I could have done
any differently. It wasn’t <i>my</i> fault that she
refused to go with Irving. It is annoying to
have this incident occur right at the outset
of our stay. It would be stupid of her to be
offended. Really that Vincent girl from first to
last has given us a great deal of annoyance!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>THE CLASH</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Robert returned Rosalie to her place
near Mrs. Nixon, a number of men who had
experienced a clinching of their admiration
by the view of her dancing, hastened to approach.</p>

<p>Many of the same people came to the inn,
season after season, and Irving knew most of
them. Some were Harvard men known to
Robert as well, and he at last being alive
to Helen’s situation, the group around the two
girls soon became extremely animated. Amidst
the strife of tongues Irving made his way to
Rosalie.</p>

<p>“This is ours?” he said.</p>

<p>As they moved away, she spoke: “I hope
I sha’n’t offend any one. I haven’t the least
idea what I’ve promised to do.”</p>

<p>In a sort of dream she started in the dance.
This was Fairport. In fifteen minutes she
could be standing in Mrs. Pogram’s kitchen,
where the clock ticked loud above the oilcloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
shelf, and Loomis Brown counted the silver
she had washed.</p>

<p>What a gulf had lain between this inn, with
its airily dressed girls and their cavaliers, and
the chill, dusky room where at dawn she had
made Loomis’s coffee before he took the early
train to Portland. Her hand tightened on
Irving’s arm while she recalled the amorous
advances of Mrs. Pogram’s brother, and his
change, after her repulsion, to anger and a mean
revenge.</p>

<p>A long, inaudible breath came quivering to
her lips as she glided on under her partner’s
perfect guidance. Rosalie loved dancing as only
the artistic nature can love it, and the rising
and falling waves of music went to her brain
like wine.</p>

<p>“Cruel Betsy! Wise Betsy!” she thought.</p>

<p>“Do you remember,” said Irving, “the last
time I held you like this?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m very dull,” she replied.
“Did we dance together in some previous
incarnation?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you wish to remember, Rosalie?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do,” she rejoined brightly. “Your
dancing couldn’t be improved.”</p>

<p>Irving kept silence. He was entirely aware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
that he was beginning exactly as Betsy had
implored him not to do; but he began to suspect
shrewdly that Betsy’s lecture was a
shield which had two sides, and that one of
them had been presented to this girl. Hadn’t
his mentor said that Rosalie—and the latter’s
totally changed manner—</p>

<p>“Betsy will end by making a conceited ass
out of me,” he reflected, with the relief human
nature finds in discovering some one else to
blame for its discomfort.</p>

<p>The dance over, he took his partner out
on the veranda, where couples were promenading
in the damp coolness. He found some
chairs in a remote corner.</p>

<p>“These are tolerably dry,” he said. “Shall
we sit here?”</p>

<p>“I mustn’t,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Why not? Too cold?”</p>

<p>“Not for me, but too damp for my gown.”</p>

<p>Irving glanced over it in the dusk. “I
have an idea that that is something pretty
fine,” he said. “I want to see the black one.”</p>

<p>Rosalie colored. “Shame on Betsy!” she
said, laughing. “Has she told everybody?”</p>

<p>“No one but me, you may be sure. Betsy
knows that I am so perfectly trustworthy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
she tells me everything. Did she ever give
me a character to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes—No—I don’t know. Let’s go into
the house, Mr. Bruce. This gown must last
me for years, and <i>years</i>.”</p>

<p>Irving obediently led the girl within doors,
where, in a corner of the hall, in lieu of palms,
were set Christmas trees in tubs. Into a seat
behind these he ushered her.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid my next partner can’t find me
here,” she said doubtfully.</p>

<p>“We have the next together.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think so, Mr. Bruce!”</p>

<p>“I know it, Rosalie. I wonder why I venture
to call you Rosalie.”</p>

<p>As he spoke Irving took up her fan and
began to use it as he gazed at her girlish profile.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she returned, a little pulse
beating in her throat. “I think, myself, Miss
Vincent would sound better.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Betsy!” thought Irving, closing his
teeth. “I’ll pay you for this.”</p>

<p>“What need of formality between sworn
friends?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I’m starting out on a new life, Mr. Bruce,”
she said, turning and looking at him with a
direct gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>She seemed to him enchanting. He knew,
better than she, that she was starting out in a
new life; and he begrudged it, strangely. He
knew her to be all unconscious as yet of her
own charm and power. He dreaded the
opening of those clear eyes that as yet were
so modest—the windows through which one
perceived her innocence. While he was justly
angry with Betsy for rousing unthought-of
suspicion and caution, he could not deny the
justice of her sympathy.</p>

<p>He met the blue gaze with a smile that set
the pulse to beating faster.</p>

<p>“You don’t intend to forget old friends for
new, do you?” he asked.</p>

<p class="center small">
“‘There is no friend like the old friend, who has shared our morning days,’<br />
</p>

<p class="unindent">you know. This little audience was enthusiastic
over you, and audiences always will be;
but—</p>

<p class="center small">
“‘Fame is the scentless sunflower, with gaudy crown of gold,’<br />
</p>

<p class="unindent">remember.”</p>

<p>“It’s unkind to laugh at me,” returned the
girl, with surprising heat. “You know I have
no thought of fame.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>“Rosalie, Rosalie!” he exclaimed and seized
her hand protectingly. “I’m not laughing at
you. I believe you could have fame if you wish
and work; but somehow I don’t want the
people to have a right to gaze at you, and
listen, and applaud.”</p>

<p>A strange film came over her eyes as she
still looked at him. It was as if she withdrew
herself as she took her hand away.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” she said, “that people who
have always had their own way are subject to
such fancies.”</p>

<p>“Betsy said that to you!” he exclaimed,
acutely.</p>

<p>She shook her head but did not speak.</p>

<p>“Betsy knows nothing of our compact.”
He leaned toward her, and she shrank, but
kept her golden head proudly lifted. “Betsy
knows nothing of the moment when we stood
above the eagles and knew what in life was—</p>

<p class="center small">
“‘the breathing rose, with sweets in every fold.’<br />
</p>

<p class="unindent">Why do I call you Rosalie? Because it means
<i>you</i>. It is one of the ‘sweets’ that came to me
then—”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bruce,” the girl interrupted him,
“Betsy <i>does</i> know nothing of it; but if she did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Betsy is something more than clever, she is
wise. She probably doesn’t read Emerson,
but if she did, it would be her own thought
that she would put into his words: ‘Our friendships
hurry to short and poor conclusions, because
we have made them a texture of wine
and dreams, instead of the tough fibre of the
human heart.’” The speaker took a firm hold
on the sweet voice that threatened to break.
“That morning was a time of wine and dreams.
I’ve always been a child. I’ve always dreamed
dreams; but to-night I am awake, I am starting
out in real life, with my eyes open.” Those
eyes had been downcast, but now she lifted
them again to her companion’s flushed face.
“I shall be very glad if you help me—and not
hinder.”</p>

<p>“The tough fibre of the human heart,”
repeated Irving.</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned the girl. “It is a slow
growth,—but it holds.”</p>

<p>A black-coated biped hovering before the
Christmas trees, now retreating and now advancing
undecidedly, heard his name with
relief.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Mr. Ames?” asked Rosalie,
rising with decision. The young man addressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
doubled around the end of the grove with
eager agility.</p>

<p>“I didn’t intend to hide,” laughed the girl.</p>

<p>Irving rose also, and when the two had gone,
sank back on the seat, playing absently with
the fan he still held.</p>

<p>His thoughts were busy, and his teeth tightly
closed.</p>

<p>“What do I want, anyway?” he reflected.
“Which is Betsy: a meddlesome busybody,
or a guardian angel? I’ll take no chances on
the angel proposition. She’s a busybody. I’ll
see her to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Irving shook his head threateningly, and a
sudden nervous twist of his strong fingers
broke a couple of sticks of the pretty fan. He
frowned in dismay, and fitted them together
in the futile manner inseparable from the
occasion.</p>

<p>“Must last her years and years,” he reflected.
“Well, it’s up to me to get her another
fan, that’s evident.” And with a clearing
of the countenance as if this consideration
presented distinct consolation, he rose and
wandered out of the arbor. “I wonder where
Madama is,” he reflected. She had not come
into his mind since her refusal of his request<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
drove him to Mrs. Nixon. “How am I to
revive her interest in Rosalie?” he wondered
as he moved down the hall.</p>

<p>As soon as Mrs. Bruce had made her
perfunctory acknowledgment to Rosalie, she
slipped from Robert’s side, unnoticed by a
culprit absorbed in his own misdemeanors,
and with one glance after Irving and Mrs.
Nixon, who were returning to the other end
of the room, she moved into the hall, and up
the stairs of the inn.</p>

<p>She made no effort to curb the hot resentment
that possessed her in every fibre. Her
one desire was to reach the cause of her suffering,
and wreak her sense of outrage upon her.</p>

<p>It was half an hour after Captain Salter’s
departure, and Betsy was smiling to herself
as she wound the living-room clock. Her
thoughts were with Rosalie; confident of
the girl’s success, yet half-frightened by the
chance of fortune which had united the Yellowstone
party to witness her début. She
imagined the scene in the spacious living-room
of the hotel. Had the rain not fallen, she had
meant to ask Hiram to take her over there,
that she might look in through the windows
and see the dear child standing, the cynosure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
of all eyes, even if she could not hear her
voice.</p>

<p>She felt certain of Mr. Derwent’s satisfaction
in her. As a contraband guest at the
Canyon Hotel, Rosalie had recited for him in
her room, and to-night Betsy’s heart swelled
in the realization that he was seeing the first
fruits of his generosity.</p>

<p>Doubts of Mrs. Bruce’s approval did sweep
occasionally, like filmy clouds, across the clear
happiness of her mind; but the importance
of Rosalie’s good fortune was paramount, and
Betsy was able to sweep them away.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard the sound of wheels
stopping before the gate. She glanced at the
clock.</p>

<p>“So early?” she thought. “They can’t be
comin’ home now.”</p>

<p>In a minute more some one ran up the
steps, and Mrs. Bruce, in a long light wrap,
a chiffon scarf falling from her elaborately
dressed hair, came swiftly into the room.</p>

<p>Betsy met the flashing eyes in dismay. She
hurried to meet her.</p>

<p>“Mercy! Mrs. Bruce—” she said, nerving
herself for some disaster. “How white you are!
Has something happened? Or are you ill?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>With her care-taking impulse Betsy tried
to remove her mistress’s wrap, but the lady
twitched away from her. She had been nursing
her wrath to keep it warm, and it was very
warm indeed; but something in Betsy’s presence,
in the gaze of those honest eyes, threatened
to make the enormity of the latter’s
offense shrink. Mrs. Bruce was obliged to
remember the attitude of Irving’s head as
he walked away with Mrs. Nixon, careless of
her own opinions or feelings, forgetful of her,—utterly
forgetful of her for the first time
in her remembrance. Her narrow mind,
tenacious of its two idols,—her own importance
and her boy,—suffered intensely.</p>

<p>“Stand away from me!” she cried; and
Betsy, too dumfounded to move, stared
mutely while the vials of Mrs. Bruce’s wrath
began to pour out.</p>

<p>“We have been too kind to you. You forget
your place. What right had you to do such
a thing as to place Rosalie Vincent where she
must be accepted as a companion by people of
our class? What right had you to interfere so
with the pleasure of our summer? Ask yourself
why you told me nothing about it. You
will say, if you are honest, that it was because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
you knew I would not approve. I have done
everything for the Vincent girl that has been
done. I had a right to be consulted, at least.
But you, forgetting that you were my servant,
went on, managing to ruin our summer,
spending, like a fool, your long years’ savings
to bring that girl east, and dress her unsuitably,
leaving me, and putting me to inconvenience
in order to do so, going entirely out
of your sphere, and making yourself a special
providence. You think yourself so clever!
Clever Betsy, indeed! Your head is turned.
It is largely our fault!”</p>

<p>She paused, panting. Betsy stood in the
same spot, but her anxious face had settled
into lines of stony stillness. Only her eyes
kept fixed on Mrs. Bruce’s face.</p>

<p>“Speak!” cried the latter, hysterically.
“How did you dare do this thing?”</p>

<p>There was another space of silence, then
Betsy did speak.</p>

<p>“Is there anything more you want to say
about it, Mrs. Bruce?”</p>

<p>The lady shrugged her shoulders angrily,
and moving to the divan dropped off her
downy wrap.</p>

<p>“I suppose nothing that I can say will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
pierce through your self-conceit; but I am
willing to have any explanation you have to
offer. You think you’ve outwitted everybody,
and you’ve succeeded in getting your own
way; but it’s nothing to be proud of, Betsy—and
old age will be coming upon you, and
you’ll think of that money a good many times,
I can tell you.”</p>

<p>She paused again, and looking up found
Betsy’s grave eyes following her. There was
another short silence, then Betsy spoke.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bruce, when you are thinkin’ this
evenin’ over, as you will, there’s just one
thing I’ll ask you to remember. It’s an old
sayin’ out o’ the far east: ‘Of the unspoken
word you are master. The spoken word is
master o’ you.’ Good-night.”</p>

<p>With this Betsy walked out of the room
without one backward look, and Mrs. Bruce
stood, baffled, and trembling with her own
excitement.</p>

<p>Alone, she sank on the divan with her face
buried in the pillows.</p>

<p>It was quite within the range of possibility
that at this moment Irving was dancing with
Rosalie Vincent, and did not even observe her
own absence from the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>She sobbed, stifling the sound in the pillows
lest Betsy should hear and return to her
assistance, believing her to be repentant.
It was like Betsy to refuse to answer her; to
treat her like a child; to throw upon her, by
her manner, the blame of all that occurred.
It was infuriating; unbearable. Her breath
came in spasms, and she fought for her self-control.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>WHITE SWEET PEAS</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Captain Salter</span>, in his five years of widowhood,
had fallen into habits that varied but
little from day to day. He cooked his own
breakfast, and was off to his boat, or to the
long shed where in winter he built them for
other people, before Mrs. Bachelder set foot
within his doors.</p>

<p>This Sabbath morning he rose, shaved, and
made his customary demi-toilet, then went
out to the stove and set the kettle to boil.</p>

<p>He lingered for a minute, smiling, before
the Yellowstone postal-cards, his thoughts
busy with the events of the evening before.</p>

<p>He held an imaginary reel in his hands and
began slowly winding the invisible line.</p>

<p>“Take your time, Miss Betsy,” he hummed.</p>

<p>His cottage stood on a corner of land, facing
out to sea. Rocks were to the left of it, a
stony beach to the right. His boat-house was
in sight. A flower-garden was in front, with a
path that ran down between the beds.</p>

<p>Many a summer visitor had admired the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
position of the little white house, and tried
to tempt Hiram to part with it; but his grandfather
had built it, and the captain’s invariable
reply to would-be purchasers was: “I
haven’t come to that, yet.”</p>

<p>By habit he now moved to the window to
note the sea’s mood. Some strange object
caught his eye. His head went forward, his
eyes seemed to bulge. A woman was seated
on the rustic bench outside. Her back was
toward him as she watched the rolling waves.
She was dressed in dark brown, with hat and
veil; and a traveling-bag reposed on the seat
beside her.</p>

<p>“Steady, Hiram, steady!” he murmured,
making long silent strides to the inner room,
and catching up his coat. He gave two
strokes of the brush to his stiff hair, and then
strode out on tiptoe again to the window.</p>

<p>“’Twa’n’t any dream,” he muttered. “She’s
there! Steady! Look out for the boom!”</p>

<p>He opened the door, and as Betsy turned
her head, he spoke, quite as if it had been his
daily custom to greet her at six-thirty <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>
in his garden.</p>

<p>“Good-mornin’. Things look kind o’ washed
up and shinin’ after the rain, don’t they?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>His keen eyes studied his caller’s face as he
advanced with a casual air.</p>

<p>“It’s a beautiful mornin’,” returned Betsy,
her hand clasping the top of her bag tightly,
and bright spots coming in her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>“You look as if you was goin’ off jauntin’
again,” said Hiram, feeling his way with care.
“Gettin’ to be such a traveler you don’t make
anythin’ of dartin’ off and dartin’ back again,
like a—like a swaller.”</p>

<p>The lump in Betsy’s throat would not let
her speak. Her silence mystified the captain
more than anything she could have said.
Determined not to frighten her, he plunged
into generalities.</p>

<p>“I think it’s about time you paid a visit
to my garden. Don’t you think it’s lookin’
good? If you’d a seen them lilies o’ the valley
a month ago ’twould ’a’ done your heart good.
They’re a-spreadin’ so, I donno but the cottage’ll
have to git up ’n git. I remembered
what you said once—that is,” added Hiram,
correcting himself lest his visitor should rise
and fly,—“my mother was always set on
sweet peas, I try to have plenty of ’em.”</p>

<p>“They’re perfectly beautiful,” said Betsy,
her eyes resting on the riot of color that embedded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
the white house in violet and rose and
white. “I think it’s my favorite flower.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you said—” began Hiram
eagerly, and then cleared his throat and stammered.
“My mother—yes, she used to say
they was like butterflies, just swayin’ on the
stem, and ready to fly.”</p>

<p>Betsy met his eyes as he stood apart, his
stalwart figure uneasily moving, now toward
her and then away, in his eager embarrassment.
Something in her look drew him close to the
seat.</p>

<p>“There ain’t any train for an hour yet,” he
said gently. “I s’pose you took a bite, but
you’ll have breakfast with me, won’t you,
Betsy, ’fore I take ye over to the depot? I
s’pose you’re leavin’ again.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>She said it gravely, and dropped her eyes
from his kind face.</p>

<p>“For how long this time?”</p>

<p>“Forever.”</p>

<p>The word was spoken quietly; but her lips
quivered.</p>

<p>“<i>What?</i>” The man started, and frowned.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 471px;">
<img src="images/i-344.jpg" width="471" height="590" alt="Man bowing bevore older lady on garden bench" />
<div class="caption">YOU’LL HAVE BREAKFAST WITH ME, WON’T YOU?</div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, Hiram,”—the lips were quivering
still, and she paused, then reached up a hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
which was quickly lost in both of his,—“can’t
you see? I’ve come home.”</p>

<p>There were only the rocks, and the beach,
and the waves that hissed and broke, to look
upon them.</p>

<p>Instantly Hiram was beside her on the
garden-seat, with Betsy in his arms, her thin
cheek pressed against his broad chest, and
sobs convulsing her slender body.</p>

<p>He scowled, and smiled at the restless sea
across his precious burden. Not a word he
said, but his big hand patted her in gentle
rhythm, and once he kissed her temple.</p>

<p>At last she pushed herself from him, and
sat up.</p>

<p>“There’s one favor I’m goin’ to beg,” she
said, with pauses, her handkerchief still at
her eyes. “That is, that you won’t ask me
why. I feel as if I couldn’t go over it.”</p>

<p>“My Betsy,” replied the captain slowly,
“there was only one question I ever wanted to
ask o’ you. I did it a good many times, ’cause
you didn’t give the right answer. Now you’ve
done it, and I sha’n’t ask ye anything more.”</p>

<p>“And Hiram,” she went on, struggling for
self-control, “I have a feelin’ as if—as if I
didn’t want it—to happen here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>“What?” asked the captain, doubtfully,
“breakfast?”</p>

<p>“No—no—the—I feel as if I didn’t
want any minister in Fairport.”</p>

<p>“I see.” He nodded. “Leave it to me,
Betsy. Leave everything to me. I know I’m
a blunderer lots o’ times; but I’ll attend to
this <i>right</i>. I love ye.” He drew her down
again on his comfortable shoulder. “Will ye
come in?” he asked, after a minute.</p>

<p>“No. I’ll stay out here, Hiram.”</p>

<p>“All right.” He kissed her forehead. “To
think ye’ll stay!” he said softly. “That’s
the wonderful part of it. To think ye’ll stay!”</p>

<p>He went into the house and brought a
calico cushion with him from somewhere,
putting it behind her back. She accepted it,
too spent to smile.</p>

<p>Hiram saw her pallor, and hastened the
breakfast. Soon a little table appeared before
the garden-seat, and coffee and toast and eggs
were speedily forthcoming.</p>

<p>He sat beside her, and arranged everything
with the utmost care.</p>

<p>“How good you are!” she said, once.
Otherwise she was silent, and so was he.</p>

<p>Before they had finished, a small boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
entered the gate with papers under his arm.
His jaw dropped as he recognized the captain
and a guest at breakfast under the ragged
balm-of-Gilead tree.</p>

<p>“B’Judas, I forgot him,” muttered the host.
“Come here, sonny.”</p>

<p>The boy obeyed, and mechanically handed
the captain his paper while keeping unwinking
eyes on Betsy. “Now d’ye want to earn a
quarter?”</p>

<p>“Yus.”</p>

<p>“Well, go to Mrs. Bachelder and tell her
somethin’ for me. Think ye can?”</p>

<p>“Yus.”</p>

<p>“She’s ben wantin’ to go to Portland and
do some tradin’. Can you tell her that I’ve
got some business to do that’ll keep me away
all to-day and she needn’t come over to get
dinner?”</p>

<p>“Yus.”</p>

<p>“And she can go up town to-day or to-morrer
mornin’ and do her tradin’ if she wants
to. Can ye tell her that?”</p>

<p>“Yus.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on then. Here’s yer quarter.
Go right there from here. D’ye hear?”</p>

<p>“Yus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>“If I find to-morrer that ye haven’t done
it, I’ll use ye for porgie-bait. Understand?”</p>

<p>“Yus.”</p>

<p>With this the boy removed his eyes from
Betsy for the first time, and ran at a dog-trot
toward the beach.</p>

<p>“I never saw that child,” said Betsy.</p>

<p>“No. There’s another generation comin’
up. He won’t be able to tell Mrs. Bachelder
who’s havin’ breakfast with me; and when
she comes home from Portland she’ll get a
letter tellin’ her she’s lost her job.”</p>

<p>“I’ll write it,” said Betsy. “She’s a good
soul.”</p>

<p>“You’ll write it!” The captain was standing,
and he paused, a cup and saucer in each
hand, and gazed at her admiringly. “Clever
Betsy! and she’s mine.”</p>

<p>“She’s taken good care of you, Hiram. I
want her to know we appreciate it.”</p>

<p>“We!” repeated the radiant man. “You
care that I’ve been took good care of, Betsy?”</p>

<p>The coffee had restored some energy to the
guest. She gave her one-sided smile. “I do
wish, Hiram,” she said deprecatingly, “that
you wouldn’t feel you’ve got so much in
gettin’ me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>To her consternation he dropped the gold-banded
old china he had been holding. Both
cups fell in tinkling pieces on the ground as he
wiped his eyes, and blew his nose lustily.</p>

<p>“O Hiram!” she cried, starting.</p>

<p>“Never mind, dear.” The man’s breath
caught. “I didn’t notice. I had to work at
the pumps. Our ship o’ matrimony is bein’
launched. Let’s say we broke ’em on purpose
over it. Nothin’ was too good. Set
still.”</p>

<p>And Betsy did. She leaned back against the
calico cushion and let her faithful lover carry
away the table, while she watched the sea, and
breathed the sumptuous perfume of the sweet
peas.</p>

<p>The last thing Hiram carried into the house
was the traveling-bag. Her hand went out
to it involuntarily as he picked it up; but he
looked at her, and she leaned back again, and
let it go.</p>

<p>At last he took his knife, and going about
the flowers, cut a large bunch of white sweet
peas. These he tied with a piece of linen
thread, and Betsy smiled as he gave them to
her. He watched while she fastened them in
the front of her white waist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you ready now?” he asked.</p>

<p>For answer she rose, and together they
moved down to the floating wharf, and Hiram
handed her into the row-boat by which they
went out to the Clever Betsy.</p>

<p>It took some time to unfurl the sails and
put them up, and Betsy went into the little
cabin and made acquaintance with her namesake.</p>

<p>It was queer, she thought, that it didn’t
seem queerer to be here, and irresponsible of
all things earthly except Hiram. Even Rosalie
did not need her. Last night’s arraignment
was proof positive of her success.</p>

<p>Her duty was here now, and nowhere else;
and the wonderful feature of the position was
that it seemed so natural, and—yes, so sweet.
As the boat bounded forward, borne on strong
white wings, Betsy’s heart seemed to soar
also into some new and freer region. Some
wireless message from a New England ancestry
reached her.</p>

<p>“Is it right to be so happy?” she asked
herself. Suddenly she turned and met Hiram’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“This is a long leg, Betsy,” he said quietly.
“Come over and sit against this cushion. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
want to get my hand on ye and know it ain’t
a dream.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s right!” answered Betsy’s heart,
and she obeyed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>IN BETSY’S ROOM</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bruce</span> did not sleep much after her
stormy ebullition. She heard Irving and Robert
come in, and knew that Irving came softly
to her door and tried it. Finding it locked, he
moved away as quietly. She knew he was feeling
a tardy anxiety about her, and she wept
again.</p>

<p>Toward morning she fell asleep, and when
next her eyes opened, the sun was high.</p>

<p>Only the slumberous sound of the sea broke
the Sabbath stillness.</p>

<p>From force of habit Mrs. Bruce put her
hand out to touch the bell on the table beside
her bed. It always summoned Betsy with the
cup of hot water she liked to drink before she
rose.</p>

<p>She arrested her own movement. What!
Was Betsy to be allowed to fall into the usual
routine and minister to her mistress’s needs
as if nothing had happened?</p>

<p>Summon her? Certainly not. Betsy must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
be made to feel that a change had taken place,
and that she must exhibit some regret before
she could be received back into favor.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Bruce arose and made her toilet,
and donning a negligée of silk and lace, proceeded
to the dining-room.</p>

<p>Irving and Robert were already there, and
Alice, the cook, was putting breakfast on the
table. Irving strode forward to meet her.
He noted her heavy eyes as he kissed her
forehead.</p>

<p>“Pardon, Madama, I thought you weren’t
coming down. Nixie and I are in a hurry, and
as long as Betsy was busy with you, I asked
Alice to put the things on the table.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce moved to her place. “Betsy
hasn’t been with me,” she said.</p>

<p>“She hasn’t? The poor dear must be ill
then,” said Irving with concern. “Alice says
she hasn’t been downstairs. Go up, will you,”
he continued to the cook who was just leaving
the room, “please go up to Betsy’s room and
see what is the matter.”</p>

<p>The three seated themselves, and Mrs.
Bruce’s dainty hands grew busy with the
coffee percolator. Irving’s furtive glances
assured him that there had been a storm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Discretion suggested that no reference be
made to last evening. Fearing therefore that
Nixie might err in that line, he hastened to
speak.</p>

<p>“We’ve a great plan on for to-day, Madama,”
he began, “and you’re in it.”</p>

<p>“That is certainly surprising,” rejoined the
lady.</p>

<p>“We tried to find you at the inn to tell you
about it last night,” said Nixie with insistent
cheer, “but you were so exclusive, nobody
knew where you were, and at last we found
you had come home.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce’s lips compressed firmly and her
eyes could not lift above the percolator.</p>

<p>Irving stepped warningly on his friend’s
foot under the table. At this juncture Alice
returned. She seemed to be laboring under
some excitement which made her forget her
previous embarrassment in the unfamiliar
region of the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Betsy isn’t there,” she said.</p>

<p>“Queer,” remarked Irving, without looking
up from the egg he was breaking.</p>

<p>“She’s <i>gone</i>!” declared the girl.</p>

<p>“Look on the dresser!” burst forth Robert
dramatically. “The note will be found.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce paused, coffee-cup in hand, and
looked at the cook, but did not speak.</p>

<p>“All right, Alice,” said Irving carelessly.
“She has run into a neighbor’s.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, it looks queer up there,” returned
the girl, her brogue increasing. “The bedclothes
is all folded. Not a thing is on the
dresser, sir. She’s <i>gone</i>.”</p>

<p>Alice’s blank expression began to be reflected
in Irving’s face.</p>

<p>“Folded? What does that signify?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“’Tis her trunk there too, sir. Locked and
strapped it is. Sure she niver said a word to
me!”</p>

<p>Irving pushed his chair back from the table.
He looked at Mrs. Bruce. She had grown very
white.</p>

<p>“Very well, Alice,” he said quietly. “I’ll
see what it means. Thank you. You may go.”</p>

<p>The Irish girl withdrew, marvelling as she
went.</p>

<p>Robert looked from mother to son, puzzled
at their seriousness.</p>

<p>“Did you know this, Madama?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” she replied stiffly.</p>

<p>“Do you believe it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think. Betsy grows
more erratic every day. She didn’t bring my
hot water this morning.”</p>

<p>Irving studied her face an instant more,
then he left the room and ran upstairs to
Betsy’s room. It was dismantled. The dresser,
where a flexible case had always stood open,
containing six pictures of himself from babyhood
to college days, was bare, even of a cover.
A trunk, locked and strapped, stood a little
way out from the bare wall.</p>

<p>Irving sat down on it in the desolate chamber,
unnerved by the shock; and although the
riddle seemed a horribly easy one to solve,
the solution was so repulsive that he prayed
to find another explanation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce’s early disappearance from the
inn, her heavy eyes this morning, Betsy’s
warnings and exhortations to him in the Park,
and Mrs. Bruce’s exhibition of unfriendliness
to Rosalie last night, all pointed to one conclusion.
His teeth clenched as he sat there,
thinking back from his earliest remembrance,
and all along through his life, of the unselfish
care which a fine nature had devoted to his
family. And this was the end. It was a nightmare.
It was impossible, unthinkable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>Robert Nixon, left alone with his hostess,
had seldom spent a more uncomfortable season
than that first five minutes after Irving’s
departure.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce stared straight before her, her
face wearing an expression of fright and obstinacy.</p>

<p>Robert, with increasing embarrassment,
began to feel that he was in the midst of some
mysterious crisis, and fervently wished himself
in the bosom of his family at the inn.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to see you look so tired, Mrs.
Bruce,” he said, when the long minutes had
made the silence impossible.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t you think he’d come down by
this time?” she asked in a strained voice. “You
see how it is, Nixie. Betsy rules this household
with a rod of iron. Here is Irving upset, won’t
eat his breakfast, just because she has taken a
notion for an early stroll.”</p>

<p>Robert did not answer, and a cuckoo popping
out of its door and remarking that it was
half-past nine, made him jump nervously.</p>

<p>An instant later Mrs. Bruce pushed her
chair back from the table, unable longer to
endure the suspense.</p>

<p>“You’ll excuse me, Nixie, if I see—” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
said, and rose. The laces of her silken gown
trailed so hurriedly through the door, that
Robert had time but to take a step after her.</p>

<p>He sank back in his chair.</p>

<p>“Well, what does it all mean?” he murmured.
“This is a cozy little vacation breakfast!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce held her lip between her teeth as
she mounted the stairs.</p>

<p>“Whatever has happened,” she thought,
“I shall hold my own. What I said to Betsy
was nothing but the truth. Irving will cross-question
me, but I don’t care—”</p>

<p>Her excitement was at fever-heat by the
time she reached the open door of Betsy’s
room.</p>

<p>She paused there and supported herself
against the jamb. What she saw acted like a
shower-bath upon her.</p>

<p>The familiar walls were stripped, the breeze
blew through the silent, empty room, and there,
seated on the trunk, was Irving, his face
buried in his hands, his broad shoulders convulsed.</p>

<p>The only time she had ever seen him weep
was when his father died. This room, too,
seemed like the chamber of death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>“Irving!” she cried out in sudden pain, and
ran to him.</p>

<p>He put out one hand and held her off. She
pressed her own lips with her fingers to hold
their quivering, and stared at him, miserably.</p>

<p>He rose from the trunk, walked over to the
window, and stood there with his back to her,
controlling himself and wiping his eyes.</p>

<p>Betsy’s words seemed to echo in her heart
as she stood, hesitating and wretched.</p>

<p>“Of the unspoken word you are master.
The spoken word is master of you.”</p>

<p>Her breath came fast. “Why has she done
this, Irving?” she asked unsteadily.</p>

<p>“That is for you to tell,—if you will,” he
answered. His voice was low and thick.</p>

<p>She drew a long sobbing breath. He had
pushed her away. He had shrunk from her.</p>

<p>“You blame me, do you, before you have
heard a word?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Let’s not have any nonsense, or justification,”
he answered, without turning. “Something
has occurred which I would have given
ten years of my life to prevent.”</p>

<p>The iron entered his listener’s soul. All her
body trembled. She did not know that at this
very moment he was fighting for her against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
his own heart; forcing himself to remember her
love for him, and the long years of her devotion.
A petty, petted woman, he reminded
himself, whose shallows he had perceived even
as a child; and he controlled the anger against
her which filled him; setting a guard upon the
tongue that longed to lash her until her pitiful
vanity should be dead beyond recall. She
stood there, mute, and he continued to stand
with his back to her.</p>

<p>“You left the inn last night, in anger,” he
said at last.</p>

<p>“Hurt! So hurt, Irving,” she cried.</p>

<p>“You came home and wreaked your ill-temper
on Betsy—Betsy, whose little finger
is of more worth than your whole body and
mine.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce panted and flushed. “I did talk
to her of her ill judgment—you don’t know,
Irving—what do you think of her spending
her savings of years on Rosalie Vincent?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course she did. Who else paid the
hundreds of dollars which brought her here
and equipped her?”</p>

<p>“An old friend of her father’s family. Betsy
had no need to spend a cent for her, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
she would have asked nothing better, I have
no doubt; because her life has been spent in
doing for others. She knew that Rosalie would
not accept such gifts from her, because that
girl is a kindred noble soul.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce took a step backward in this
destruction of the very foundation of her
defense.</p>

<p>“I don’t ask to know all the pitiful scene
that took place. This,” Irving indicated the
desolation of the room with a wave of his
hand, “this speaks. Betsy has gone—”</p>

<p>“She did it in revenge,” cried Mrs. Bruce.
“She knew how it would make you suffer. She
wanted to punish me.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” said Irving, “I know Betsy. She
has been driven out of my father’s house—<i>my</i>
house—without first talking to me; without
putting her good arms around my neck—” The
speaker’s voice stopped short; his
shoulders were again convulsed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce stood in the same spot, watching
him with miserable eyes, wringing her hands.</p>

<p>“Don’t—don’t say such things, Irving.
Don’t feel so. I’ll—I’ll do anything. I’ll find
her and—and apologize—I was mistaken—I’ll
say so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>Irving made a gesture of repression. She
gazed at him, mute and miserable.</p>

<p>At last he turned and faced her. She was a
figure to excite compassion in that moment,
as she met the regard of his reddened eyes.</p>

<p>“It is too late for that, Madama. The
break has come. It can’t be mended. Betsy
would never go in this way if there were a
possibility of her coming back.”</p>

<p>A sense of her own loss came to Mrs. Bruce
with the kinder tone of Irving’s voice.</p>

<p>“I wish to speak to you also of another
matter; of the cause of your excitement last
night, before we part.”</p>

<p>“Part!” she repeated acutely.</p>

<p>“I mean only leaving this room. I wish for
your own sake that you may regret the unwomanliness
of your attitude toward Miss
Vincent—Rosalie.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce lifted questioning, dilated eyes.</p>

<p>“To think that it was she—that innocent
girl, who could move you to cause this disaster.
Examine your own consciousness. See what
it is that could give the Powers of Darkness
such easy access and sway.”</p>

<p>“I was jealous, Irving—jealous of Mrs.
Nixon—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>“And angry because you could not dominate
the situation,” added Irving.</p>

<p>A painful color burned Mrs. Bruce’s face.</p>

<p>“I’m going to tell you,” he went on after
a pause, “that no girl I have ever met has
attracted me as Rosalie Vincent does.”</p>

<p>“Irving!”</p>

<p>“I’ve known many charming girls. They
are all in one class. She is in another. I don’t
understand it. I don’t know what it may mean.
I tell you this because it may mean everything
to me; and I feel it is due you to know it,
since your sentiment toward Rosalie seems
so strong. Then you can decide what your
attitude will be for the remainder of the summer.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce regarded him, her lips apart.</p>

<p>After a pause he spoke in his ordinary voice.</p>

<p>“We planned last evening that the Yellowstone
party should go on a picnic to-day with
Captain Salter. Do you care to go?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Nor I. I would give a great deal to have
this day, alone.” Again his throat closed.</p>

<p>“To mourn! to mourn!” thought Mrs.
Bruce, wretchedly.</p>

<p>“But I can’t. I must go at once to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
captain, and then up to the inn. Good-by,
Madama.” He approached and laid a hand
on her shoulder. He realized the blow he had
given her. “We must do the best we can,”
he said, and left the room.</p>

<p>She stood there, long, in the same position.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” she thought confusedly, “if
I am not the most miserable woman in the
world.”</p>

<p>After a while she moved, and spoke through
a tube which led to the kitchen. She told
Alice that she would not need to get any dinner.
Then she went to her room and closed
the door. Stillness reigned again but for the
subdued roar of waves.</p>

<p>“Some one will come for her trunk,” she
reflected. “If she took a morning train it will
have to be expressed.”</p>

<p>She held to that thought in the long hours
of exhaustion that followed. Some one would
come for the trunk, and she must not be asleep.</p>

<p>The middle of the afternoon a wagon
stopped before the house. Mrs. Bruce was
off her bed, alertly.</p>

<p>The feet of the expressman sounded on the
stairs. Mrs. Bruce met him in the upper hall.
To her relief it was a stranger who appeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>“A trunk to go from here?” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes.” She led the way. “Is it prepaid?”
she asked as he laid hands upon it.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Sha’n’t I do it then? Where is it to go?”
The speaker’s heart beat fast under the careless
words.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am. No need. Cap’n Salter’s
good.”</p>

<p>“Captain—” She arrested herself. “Oh,
it’s to go to the captain’s.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce returned to her room and sat
on the side of the bed in deep meditation.
Betsy might store her possessions in the
house of an old friend until her plans were
made.</p>

<p>The sense of desolation that overtook her
as the trunk had disappeared submerged her
afresh; and Irving’s words returned to pierce
her.</p>

<p>Rosalie Vincent—in a class by herself. Her
splendid Irving, whose career was to have made
her life one pageant of gratified pride.</p>

<p>She sank upon her pillows with a groan.
Her world was falling about her like a flimsy
house of cards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>In the evening she heard him come in. He
had to pass her room to get to his. She stood
in the open doorway.</p>

<p>“Did you enjoy your picnic, dear?” she
asked, as he appeared.</p>

<p>“We didn’t have any. I found Captain
Salter’s house deserted, and his boat gone.
I’ve been taking a long walk.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! I thought perhaps you would
find—find Betsy at Captain Salter’s.”</p>

<p>“Why?” the question was quick.</p>

<p>“Her trunk went there this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Madama!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce felt a faint satisfaction in the
amazement her information conveyed.</p>

<p>“I wonder—” said Irving; and repeated
vaguely, “I wonder.”</p>

<p>“I thought she might be storing it there,”
hazarded Mrs. Bruce meekly.</p>

<p>Irving stood, thinking, for a minute, but
to her disappointment he made no reply.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” he said, and kissed her forehead
as he had always done.</p>

<p>He went on to his room, his thoughts
busy.</p>

<p>The house was deserted. The boat was gone.
That was what she had done, then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>“Betsy! Dear Betsy!” he murmured.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch, then took a sudden
determination.</p>

<p>Like a thief he stole downstairs without a
sound, and out of doors.</p>

<p>Then he started on a slow, steady run down
the village street. It was not a long pull to the
isolated cottage among the rocks, and when
he came in sight of it he was rewarded by
seeing a light in the windows.</p>

<p>Stealthily drawing near, he peered within.
There he could see a cheerful tea-table, and
Captain Salter and Betsy eating their late
supper.</p>

<p>A lump rose in his throat. The trunk still
stood on the piazza, and he passed it, to open
the door gently. Smiling and dim-eyed he
stood before the pair, who pushed their chairs
back from the table.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>Irving</i>!” cried the captain’s big
voice.</p>

<p>He extended a welcoming hand, but the
visitor did not see it. He had fallen on his
knees beside the bride’s chair, and buried his
face in her lap.</p>

<p>She put both arms around his shoulders as
she had done a hundred times to console some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
childish grief, and sudden tears rained from
the eyes she raised to her husband.</p>

<p>The captain rose, and walked over to the
window.</p>

<p>Irving lifted his cheek to Betsy’s breast.</p>

<p>“Mr. Irving, dear,” she said brokenly, “you
know—”</p>

<p>“Yes. Don’t explain. Don’t speak. I know.
But I remember, Betsy. I remember so much,
that I couldn’t stay away. My mother and
you, Betsy. My mother and you.—So much.—So
much that I can’t say—But my heart
is full of it—and I wanted to kiss you—to
kiss you before I went to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Darling boy! Darling child!” said Betsy,
and pressed her cheek against his hair.</p>

<p>Then she kissed him tenderly, and he her,
and he rose, and with a parting caress of his
hand upon hers, crossed to the bridegroom,
quietly blowing his nose by the window.</p>

<p>“Congratulations,” he said thickly.</p>

<p>The captain seized his offered hand speechlessly,
and a mighty mutual grip ensued.</p>

<p>Then Irving slipped out of the open door,
closed it softly behind him, and ran down the
garden’s perfumed path.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small>BETSY RECEIVES</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Betsy’s</span> letter to Mrs. Bachelder was a lighted
match to a fuse. Within an hour Betsy’s Fairport,
to a man, woman, and child, knew that
she had linked her fortunes to Captain Salter’s.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pogram was one of the first to call
upon the bride. Enveloped in a black shawl,
and moving with heavy deliberation, the
mournful lady walked up the path bordered
with fragrant pinks, and looked with lugubrious
but appreciative eyes about the sunny
garden of the rock-bound cottage.</p>

<p>Betsy saw her coming, and opened the door.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Mrs. Pogram. This is neighborly,”
she said.</p>

<p>The visitor regarded her with doleful curiosity,
examining her gingham dress and white
apron, and the smooth arrangement of her trim
head, with approval.</p>

<p>“You look awfully well, Betsy,” she said.</p>

<p>“Will you come in, or do you like to sit out
here in the sunshine?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Pogram sniffed. “The grass is kind
o’ damp, I guess,” she objected.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is,” said Betsy. “Come in, then.
Before another summer we’re goin’ to have a
real nice veranda all across the front.”</p>

<p>“How you talk!” returned the caller, following
her inside and accepting a cushioned
rocker. “It sounds good to hear of anybody
prosperin’. I haven’t scarcely got my breath
since I heard o’ your marriage. And they say
you wasn’t married in Fairport. They say
you took the boat and went off and had a
preacher from Mere Point row out with a
witness and get aboard and marry you, ’cause
Hiram wanted the knot tied on the sea; said
he was goin’ to have a sailor’s knot and make
a sure thing of it. And then I heard you all
danced a hornpipe!”</p>

<p>Betsy laughed into the curious face with its
down-drawn lips. “What a good time somebody
had spinnin’ that yarn,” she said. “Now
tell me about yourself, Mrs. Pogram.”</p>

<p>“It looks awful comfortable here,” declared
the visitor wistfully. “I didn’t know as you
and Hiram was goin’ to get married.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see we did. I’m your neighbor
now, for good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Tis good, Betsy. ’Tis so.”</p>

<p>The visitor rocked as she inspected. Her
gloomy garb and countenance in the cheerful
room gave an effect as of a portly raven in a
solarium.</p>

<p>“If you’d ’a’ give folks some warnin’,” she
went on, “you’d ’a’ had presents from your
well-wishers and old friends. Why was you
so suddent, Betsy?”</p>

<p>The hostess directed a one-sided smile
toward the open window, near which she was
sitting. “Sometimes things that seem sudden
have been a long time growin’,” she said.</p>

<p>“I s’pose so. I think a sight of you,” declared
the visitor with a sniff. “I’d like
nothin’ better’n to give you a spoon if I
thought there was any hope o’ Loomis not
noticin’ it; but Loomis is goin’ to get married
himself, and he’s more’n ever set on keepin’
the estate together. I’ve been thinkin’ a
whole lot about it, ’cause I’ve decided that
when he’s got his own home I’d ruther make
a division. I’d ruther have less and not be
pestered.”</p>

<p>“I would, too,” said Betsy.</p>

<p>“And if that time ever comes, you can count
on me for a spoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you,” returned the bride. “Don’t
worry about it, Mrs. Pogram. I think even
more of the will than the deed.”</p>

<p>“Well, I heard from Rosalie at last,” announced
the caller. “She was in Boston, and
had found some old friend of her father’s who
was doin’ for her. She didn’t say much, just
a real pleasant little note, sayin’ she was all
right and would let me hear again soon.”
Mrs. Pogram lowered her voice, lest her
brother’s dapper astral body might be floating
near. “Her note cheered me up consid’able,
Betsy, and I’ve been thinkin’ that after
Loomis was married I could have Rosalie
back again, just as well as not!”</p>

<p>Betsy’s face grew inscrutable. “I saw
Rosalie in Boston myself,” she began; and at
that moment the door, which had been ajar,
opened, and the girl herself appeared before
them.</p>

<p>She wore a dark-blue sailor suit, her sleeves
were rolled up, and her face was alight with
feeling.</p>

<p>“I heard my name!” she cried. “Oh,
Betsy, I’ve just learned about you!”</p>

<p>In an instant the two were locked in each
other’s arms, while Mrs. Pogram, her mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
open, her eyes winking as if to dispel cobwebs,
leaned back in her chair.</p>

<p>“Do you see my visitor?” asked Betsy.</p>

<p>“Why, Auntie Pogram! You?” said the
girl; and hastening to the sombre figure, she
kissed her. “I was coming to see you to-day,”
she went on. “It was my first opportunity.
Everything has happened so fast.”</p>

<p>“You’re—” stammered Mrs. Pogram amazedly,
“you’re livin’ in Fairport, Rosalie?”</p>

<p>“Yes, at the inn.”</p>

<p>If it were possible for Mrs. Pogram’s back
to cling more limply to her chair, it did so
now.</p>

<p>The girl laughed. “Yes, it’s a fairy story,
Auntie Pogram, but I’m living at the inn
and paying for my board in the pleasantest
way.”</p>

<p>“Waitin’ on table?” asked Mrs. Pogram.</p>

<p>“No;” the girl flushed and laughed. “Speaking
pieces, just the way I used to do for you.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so! I was just tellin’ Betsy,
Loomis is goin’ to get married; and then I
want you to come back to me, Rosalie.”</p>

<p>A creeping nausea stole around the girl’s
heart.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said, “but I’ve grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
so conceited I believe I can make my own
living.”</p>

<p>Betsy watched her in fond silence; and Rosalie
returned to her side. “I just looked in to
hug you and to say I’m glad,” she said. “I’ll
come again, soon.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do to-day?” asked
Betsy.</p>

<p>“I’m going canoeing with Mr. Nixon.”</p>

<p>“With Mr. Nixon,” repeated Betsy.</p>

<p>She was sorry they could not speak alone.
She saw by the girl’s face there was much she
was repressing.</p>

<p>“The people are planning a Yellowstone
picnic with Captain Salter,” continued Rosalie.
“We’re to sail to some far-away beach
and have a clambake. Don’t forget that
you’re a Yellowstoner even if you are a
bride.”</p>

<p>“Rosalie,” returned Betsy, “if the people
are kind enough to suggest my goin’ on any
o’ these excursions, I want you to tell ’em that
I’d rather not.”</p>

<p>The girl stood silent for a moment. Robert
had told her as much as he knew, which was
the mere fact of the marriage. He had asked
nothing of Irving, and had not mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
Betsy’s flight; but Rosalie guessed enough
to understand.</p>

<p>“You can tell them that my weddin’ was a
very hurried one and that I’m busy, and will
be all summer,” added Betsy.</p>

<p>The girl inspected the room.</p>

<p>“I was here once before,” she said. “How
different it looks!”</p>

<p>Betsy smiled. “I guess Cap’n Salter kept
the blinds shut a good deal,” she returned.
“I calc’late to make it look real nice here
before I get through.”</p>

<p>Rosalie looked at her wistfully. “Isn’t it
fun!” she said. “It’s a pretty cottage, and as
for what you see from here—why, the inn
has nothing like it.”</p>

<p>A man’s step crunched the garden-path and
a knock sounded at the door. Robert Nixon
appeared.</p>

<p>“May I come in?” he cried cheerfully.
“Mrs. Betsy!” he added, as the hostess
started up, “I thought it would be a good time
to run over and pay my respects, for I knew
you had company anyway, and I wanted you
to know that I bear no malice for your unkindness
in the past.”</p>

<p>Betsy shook hands with him heartily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
“Mrs. Pogram, this is Mr. Nixon,” she
said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pogram’s eyes had found their greatest
width, and they remained there, unwinking,
while Robert bowed.</p>

<p>“Any time’s a good time, Mr. Nixon,”
went on the hostess. “The latch-string will
be always out.”</p>

<p>“Say, this is pretty nice, do you know it?”
exclaimed Robert, looking about. “Such a
corking view!”</p>

<p>Seeing Betsy in her usual trim garb, and
with no line of care in her forehead, the young
man asked himself if she could bear any relation
to that tragical Sunday morning.</p>

<p>“You look as if you’d always been here,”
he said.</p>

<p>“I really feel that way,” replied Betsy.
“Sit down, Mr. Nixon.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to, but I can’t. I have to take this
young lady and bear her off to my light canoe.
Brute’s gone to Boston and it’s my innings.”</p>

<p>Betsy saw Rosalie’s blush and the sudden
gravity of her face.</p>

<p>“She’s got ’em all cinched up there at the
inn,” he rattled on. “Have to stand in line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
now to get an hour of her. Good-by, Betsy—I
don’t have to call you Mrs. Salter, do I?”</p>

<p>The bride laughed and reassured him, and
with a few more words the young people disappeared.</p>

<p>“Who’s he?” asked Mrs. Pogram sepulchrally.</p>

<p>“A young man from Boston. We met him
in the Yellowstone.”</p>

<p>“Rosalie said—” began the visitor.</p>

<p>“Yes,” interrupted Betsy, returning to her
seat with a repressed sigh. “I’ll explain.”</p>

<p>Then she told her caller the outline of
Rosalie’s experience, foreseeing that much
future heartburning would be averted by
frankness.</p>

<p>“Rosalie and I came pretty close out there,”
she finished, “and this house’ll be her headquarters
next winter if she has idle times;
which I don’t think she will.”</p>

<p>“But after Loomis is married—” began Mrs.
Pogram.</p>

<p>“Yes, but you see we didn’t know Loomis
was goin’ to be married, and Cap’n Salter’s
very fond o’ Rosalie, and we’ve made our
plans.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Mrs. Pogram reflectively. “She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
looks like a new girl. I didn’t know as she was
so pretty.”</p>

<p>“Some evenin’ soon,” said Betsy kindly,
“you’ll come over here to supper with me,
and I’ll fix it up with Sam Beebe to let us go
to the inn and sit in some corner outside an
open window, and we’ll see and hear Rosalie
give her little show. You’ll be real pleased
with her.”</p>

<p>“I guess I shall,” returned Mrs. Pogram, in
a sort of maze. “I guess I shall. There was
always somethin’ out o’ the ordinary about
her. I used to think it was that made Loomis
mad.” Mrs. Pogram’s eyes looked into a void.
“He’s goin’ to marry a real nice girl—poor
thing!” she added.</p>

<p>Delicacy restrained Betsy from inquiring
which of the contracting parties was thus
apostrophized by a fond sister, and in a few
minutes her caller left.</p>

<p>By a strange coincidence Mrs. Pogram was
present a week later, when one afternoon
Captain Salter approached his cottage laden
with a heavy wooden case which he carried
on his shoulder. He groaned in spirit as he
beheld through the window the visitor’s ample
sable proportions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s goin’ to be Betsy’s trouble,” he
muttered. “Everybody thinks too darned
much of her.”</p>

<p>He gave the caller a cheerful nod, however,
as he entered the living-room. He was too
happy himself not to let good cheer overflow
upon all mankind.</p>

<p>Betsy regarded the heavy case with surprise.</p>

<p>“What ye been sendin’ to Boston for?”
he asked, lowering his burden.</p>

<p>“Nothin’. To Boston? There’s some mistake.”</p>

<p>She approached and read the inky address.
“Mrs. Hiram Salter.” The name was clear.</p>

<p>Hiram brought some tools and opened the
wooden box, then began to take out the packing
within.</p>

<p>“It’s a weddin’ present,” exclaimed Mrs.
Pogram, throwing back her shawl in the excitement
of the moment, and thanking the
lucky star which had made her keep on from
the market to the Salter cottage.</p>

<p>Tissue paper began to come into view.</p>

<p>Hiram looked at Betsy. “I guess I’ve gone
as far as I darst,” he said.</p>

<p>Color came into her cheeks as she lifted out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
package after package and laid them on the
table. Mrs. Pogram rocked violently.</p>

<p>Captain Salter lifted away the wooden case
and packing.</p>

<p>An envelope caught Betsy’s eye. She opened
it and read the card within.</p>

<p>“O Hiram!” she exclaimed brokenly. “It’s
Mr. Irving!”</p>

<p>“Irvin’ Bruce,” cried Mrs. Pogram, raising
herself in her chair and dropping back again.</p>

<p>Betsy gave the card to her husband.</p>

<p>He read on it: “To dear Betsy, with her
boy’s love.”</p>

<p>A slow, broad smile grew on Hiram’s bronzed
face, and he watched motionless while Betsy
opened her treasures.</p>

<p>Only Mrs. Pogram’s breathless ejaculations
broke the stillness.</p>

<p>“I never!—I never did!—Fit for a queen!—And
I wanted to give you a spoon!”</p>

<p>For the morocco cases held silver with the
rose pattern which Irving knew that Betsy
loved.</p>

<p>There were a dozen tea-spoons, half a dozen
table-spoons, and the same number of forks
and silver knives. A silver teapot, cream-pitcher
and sugar-bowl of colonial design<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
crowned the show. Every article except the
knives was engraved with an F. upon which
Captain Salter gazed with admiration.</p>

<p>The good soul could not even begrudge Mrs.
Pogram’s presence at the unveiling of so much
splendor; for the raven more nearly resembled
a lark now, in her chirps and cries of
joy.</p>

<p>Hiram held his wife in an embrace while
they stood looking upon the array.</p>

<p>“You want to bring the burglars down on
me, that’s what you want, Betsy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s too handsome, too handsome!”
Betsy was murmuring. “Mr. Irving hadn’t
ought to spent so much money!” She held
the card against her breast.</p>

<p>“I hain’t a particle of objection,” said
Hiram jovially. “Would <i>you</i> have, Mrs. Pogram?”</p>

<p>The latter was eyeing the tea-set.</p>

<p>“It’s lots like mine,” she answered, with
recovered recollection of the Brown-Pogram
estate. “I’m just bound and determined
Loomis’s wife shan’t have my tea-set!”</p>

<p>“We can’t do anything but eat, to do justice
to it, Betsy,” went on Hiram.</p>

<p>And she turned her head and buried her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
face on his breast, while he kept his arms
around her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pogram began to be inspired with the
idea that perhaps the pair would not mind
being left alone for a little while.</p>

<p>“Betsy’s kind o’ worked up,” she said
leniently, to Hiram. “She set so much store
by Irvin’. I’ll just go on, and see her some
other time.”</p>

<p>Some of Mercury’s fleetness was lent to the
visitor’s heavy sandals as she considered the
number of neighbors she could see on her way
home; and before bed-time that night, it
was known in Fairport that the Bruce family
had given to Captain Salter’s bride a complete
dinner-service of solid silver, a watch
studded with diamonds, and Oriental rugs for
every room in the cottage!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>GOOD-BY, SUMMER</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">One</span> errand which Irving Bruce performed in
Boston besides buying Betsy’s wedding present,
was to seek out a poor relation of his
step-mother’s in her suburban home, and
carry her back with him to Fairport.</p>

<p>He wired: “Miss Frost is returning with
me.”</p>

<p>And such was Mrs. Bruce’s loneliness, and
worry, and desire to hide from her friends,
that never did poor relation receive a more
cordial welcome.</p>

<p>Miss Frost, a bird-like little person with a
high apologetic voice, was bewildered with joyful
excitement.</p>

<p>“I haven’t a <i>thing</i> to wear, my dear, not
a thing!” she cried to her hostess on her arrival;
“but Irving was so <i>perfectly</i> lovely, he
wouldn’t let me <i>wait</i> for <i>anything</i>; and he told
me how you’ve let that valuable Betsy go to
this faithful lover of <i>years</i>, so like you, always
to think of <i>others</i>, and Irving says you’re <i>tired</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
so that really perhaps I <i>can</i> take some care
of you, and it will be such a <i>joy</i> to feel that
I’m not <i>useless</i> in this beautiful, beautiful
spot, and you never <i>could</i> look anything but
<i>pretty</i>, Laura, but I do think you <i>show</i> the
natural fatigue of <i>travel</i>,” etc., etc.</p>

<p>This combination of flattery and confidence
bound up some of Mrs. Bruce’s wounds. She
did make the newcomer useful, not only in the
actual labor of housekeeping, but as an excuse
for not going where she did not wish to be.</p>

<p>But meanwhile she lived a life within herself
which her cousin never suspected. Daily
the battle between love and pride was renewed.
Robert Nixon remained with them,
and through him, more than through Irving,
she learned of Rosalie’s continued vogue.</p>

<p>She declined the sailing party which went
out with Captain Salter, and Miss Frost was
with difficulty persuaded to go in her place.</p>

<p>Upon her return, blown and dishevelled,
but joyful, Mrs. Bruce met her cousin with
veiled eagerness.</p>

<p>“Did they think it very strange of me not
to come, Lavinia?”</p>

<p>“Why of course they were <i>disappointed</i>,”
chirped the little woman, endeavoring to tuck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
up the flying strands of her gray hair; “but
when I told them how you felt it a <i>duty</i> to rest
<i>absolutely</i> for a week, they understood. I told
them how I disliked to leave you alone, but
that you never <i>could</i> think of your<i>self</i>, and
were determined I should have the pleasure,
and so I <i>came</i>; and oh, Laura, it was the
most <i>lovely</i> sail; I did wish every <i>minute</i> for
you!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce in her chastened state drank
in the praise which she knew was sincere.</p>

<p>“Lavinia Frost is really a much more agreeable
person to have about than Betsy,” she
thought.</p>

<p>Those clear eyes of Betsy’s which had
always seemed to read her through and
through, appeared to her mental vision now
as she mounted the stairs after her cousin, and
followed her to her room, remaining with her
while the visitor repaired the ravages of wind
and wave.</p>

<p>“Do you think Mrs. Nixon enjoyed the
excursion?” asked Mrs. Bruce.</p>

<p>Miss Frost raised her hands and dilated her
eyes expressively. “I’m afraid not! She’s not
a good sailor; but the <i>young</i> people—Oh,
what a good time they did have, Laura!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>A little contracting pain, grown familiar,
seized the listener.</p>

<p>“Go on. Tell me about it,” she replied
quietly.</p>

<p>“Well, you know how <i>amusing</i> Mr. Nixon
always is,” began Miss Frost, spreading cold
cream over her sunburn; “(so <i>like</i> you, dear
Laura, to give me this cream). He and Miss
Maynard—such an <i>elegant</i> girl, Miss Maynard—and
dear Irving, and that <i>lovely</i>
creature Miss Vincent, all four sang together.”</p>

<p>“Did they? Did they sing well?”</p>

<p>“Yes, <i>indeed</i>; but you know they’re so full
of <i>fun</i> they couldn’t stick to anything serious,
and Miss Vincent sang some coon songs.
O Laura, that girl is <i>wonderfully</i> talented. She
made Mr. Derwent laugh as hard as the boys.
<i>Splendid</i>-looking man, Mr. Derwent. I really—I
expect I’m a silly old thing, but I couldn’t
<i>help</i> weaving <i>romances</i> out in that boat, those
four delightful young people were so <i>tempting</i>
to the <i>imagination</i>.”</p>

<p>“Really?” asked Mrs. Bruce. “How did
you pair them off in your own mind?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t have to pair them off,” twittered
the little woman. “Irving was beside that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
<i>charming</i> young creature with the gold crown,—you
know the way that broad soft braid
goes around her head,—he was beside her all
the time. I just <i>hoped</i> she appreciated his
attentions; but do you know I watched them
<i>closely</i>, and I never saw her look at him <i>once</i>!
She was pleasant and gay all the time,—but
I just said to myself, can—it—be <i>possible</i>
that that girl is more attracted by our droll
Nixie than by that <i>prince</i>? I’ve often heard
you say you dreaded Irving’s falling in love;
you’ve always been so like brother and sister,
it isn’t to be wondered at; but when Mr.
Nixon told me what a good <i>angel</i> you’d been
to that talented girl, I thought I could <i>see</i> that
you had your little plans!”</p>

<p>Lavinia Frost closed one eye, and nodded
knowingly at her cousin, whose flushed face
disclosed nothing.</p>

<p>“I told him that was the way you’d gone
through <i>life</i>. I told him about the stove you
gave me for my living-room, and now what a
grand outing you were giving me here, and so
thoughtfully letting me feel myself of some
<i>use</i>. O Laura, it’s a splendid thing to be rich
and powerful, but it’s better still to have that
big heart and soul that <i>uses</i> the power to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
spread <i>blessings</i> along the paths of others less
fortunate!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce kept silent. Miss Frost washed
the cream from her hands and began winding
up her sparse hair.</p>

<p>“It’s awfully thin, you see. Not much more
than nine hairs, Laura,” she laughed, “three
behind to braid, and one on each side to
puff. I don’t <i>want</i>,” she continued after a
silence, “to see anything you don’t <i>wish</i> me
to, but I <i>could</i>—not—help—thinking that
Irving admired that girl <i>extremely</i>; and though
I know you’re above such considerations, I
couldn’t help being <i>glad</i> she was well-connected
as well as beautiful. One of the Derwent
family. Think of it! Mr. Nixon told
me so, and it was plain to see that Mr. Derwent
thinks the world of her. Such an elegant
man! And what do you suppose he said
to me, Laura? As we were leaving the boat
he said with such a <i>charming</i> bow—perfectly
<i>charming</i>! He said, ‘I think in some way
you have been given the wrong <i>name</i>, Miss
Frost. <i>I</i> think it should be Miss <i>Spring</i>!”
Lavinia gave a joyous but apologetic giggle.
“Wasn’t that a perfectly <i>lovely</i> thing for him
to say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Bruce regarded the speaker thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Lavinia,” she said, “how should you like
to stay with me?”</p>

<p>“Stay with you—my <i>dear</i>?” The little
woman stood stock-still, the dress skirt she
was about to put on, in her hand.</p>

<p>“Yes,—keep house for me in Boston.”</p>

<p>“Why, Lavinia, it would be <i>heaven</i>—but,
how <i>can</i> I!”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you? It is only to give up a
few rooms in somebody else’s house. You’re
quite alone.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I am,” replied Lavinia slowly,
“but somehow I never realize it.”</p>

<p>What a wealth of implication lay in the
simple words! Mrs. Bruce could not appreciate
that, but she persisted in her plan, which
had been gradually taking form for days.</p>

<p>A capable, useful, refined admirer was what
her beaten and dependent soul yearned for.</p>

<p>Tears dimmed Lavinia’s eyes when at last
she accepted the offer.</p>

<p>“Laura!” she exclaimed, with touching
sincerity, “you have been planning this beautiful
thing for me! <i>That</i> is why Irving brought
me here. Dear Irving, always so courteous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
he has been, to your relatives! Dear Laura,
when do you <i>ever</i> take time to think of yourself!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day in the second week in September,
Betsy stood by a window in her cottage and
saw Rosalie, in hat and street dress, enter the
garden. She watched the girl unnoticed, and
saw her turn and look seaward. Clouds were
scudding along the sky, and swallows circling
against the strong breeze. Presently Rosalie
came up the path.</p>

<p>Betsy threw open the door. “Welcome
home!” she said, and embraced her.</p>

<p>“I’m the most fortunate girl in the world,”
declared Rosalie.</p>

<p>Betsy took the bag she carried. “Let me
show you your room,” she said.</p>

<p>With happy pride she led the guest up the
narrow stairs, and ushered her into a comfortable
little bower, hung in white dimity.</p>

<p>Rosalie turned, and gave her hostess another
hug. “Why should you be so good to me?”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Because you’re all the little girl I’ve got,”
returned Betsy. “See what a nice cozy corner
that makes for your trunk!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>Rosalie regarded her affectionately. “I
have the greatest news for you,” she said.
“I can only stay two days.”</p>

<p>“Answers to the advertisement, eh?” asked
Betsy with interest.</p>

<p>“Better than that! How wonderfully good
people are! Mr. Derwent actually went to
Portland weeks ago, and managed somehow,
so that yesterday I received a summons from
the Moore School to come and take up my
work there. It seems that some of the faculty
have heard me at the inn, and it’s settled,
practically.”</p>

<p>“All the better, child. Cap’n Salter and I’d
never get tired o’ havin’ you here, but you
wouldn’t be satisfied with an idle winter in
Fairport. Come in my room and sit down for
a chat. I’m doin’ some mendin’, and we can
settle all the affairs o’ the nation.”</p>

<p>Rosalie followed into the front room, and
seated herself by a low window looking out
on the gray billows.</p>

<p>“Good-by, summer,” she said, as if to herself.</p>

<p>Betsy glanced at her and sat down by the
bed where were scattered articles of clothing.</p>

<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Wheeling out on a windy sky—”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">sang the girl softly.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Betsy, “when you take ’count
o’ stock, what sort of a summer has it been?”</p>

<p>“Wonderful.”</p>

<p>“That may be,” returned Betsy, “but how
about the net result. Would you like to live
it over again?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!” was the fervent reply.
“<i>No</i>, Betsy! What am I talking about! No,
I wouldn’t. I might not do so well again.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” asked the other,
beginning to make a lattice-work across the
vacant toe of a man’s sock. “Do you mean
professionally?”</p>

<p>“Not altogether,” answered the girl slowly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean socially too, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Silence, while the breakers struck and burst
on the rock at the left of the cottage.</p>

<p>“Whom have you over here?” Rosalie rose
and moved to the dresser where a flexible
leather case stood in a semi-circle. “Captain
Salter?” She picked up the case. “Irving!”
she added in a different tone, and studied the
six pictures with down-drooped face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>“See the envelope standin’ there against the
glass? You can open it. It came with my
silver.”</p>

<p>Rosalie obeyed. “Oh!” she said softly.</p>

<p>Presently Betsy spoke again: “I’ve heard
a lot about how popular you’ve been all
summer. Says I to myself, there’s safety in
numbers, says I.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Rosalie, “there’s safety in
numbers.”</p>

<p>She returned the card to its envelope.</p>

<p>“Take the pictures over to the window if
you’d like to,” said Betsy, mending busily.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” returned the girl; and
placing the case as she had found it, she came
back to her seat.</p>

<p>“The Nixon party got off all right, I s’pose,”
said Betsy. “Mr. Nixon came over to say
good-by. Did you know Mr. Derwent took
supper with the cap’n and me one night?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He is greatly taken with Captain
Salter.”</p>

<p>“We had a real good time,” said Betsy,
“and he praised the supper.”</p>

<p>“There are no suppers as good as yours.
Nixie and I had made him hungry telling him
about the dinner we had with you that day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>“And my boy never broke bread with me
once,” said Betsy sadly. “I couldn’t ask him
away from Mrs. Bruce.”</p>

<p>“Betsy,” asked Rosalie wistfully, “whatever
did happen?”</p>

<p>Betsy shook her head. “Nothin’ you need
worry about, child.”</p>

<p>“But that’s just what troubles me. I’ve
always believed it was about me.”</p>

<p>“Rosalie,”—Betsy lifted her eyes from her
work for a minute,—“do you know it says in
the Bible that God makes the wrath o’ man
to praise him? or somethin’ like that? I’ve
thought of it often since I’ve been livin’ here.
There had to be some kind of an explosion for
Hiram to get his rights. I see now he’s only
got his rights.”</p>

<p>“But one thing is very strange,” said
Rosalie. “The few times I’ve spoken with
Mrs. Bruce this summer, she has been quite
polite to me. Do you know about this cousin
who is with her, this cunning little Miss Frost,
more like a canary-bird than any one I ever
saw? Well, she adores Mrs. Bruce, and do you
know it has seemed to me that Mrs. Bruce
is trying to live up to it. Wouldn’t that be
strange?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>Betsy dropped her work and regarded the
speaker.</p>

<p>“Miss Lavinia Frost,—I know her well.
She don’t <i>seem</i> to wear spectacles, but she’s
got a pair on all the time. Rose-color. Mrs.
Bruce went out to her rooms once and she
didn’t like the looks of ’em, and she took
one of her notions and fixed ’em up with a
handsome stove, and an arm-chair, and some
other nice things, and Miss Frost never could
get over it.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bruce is going to keep her with her.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” exclaimed Betsy. “Nothin’ could
be better.” She shook her head and resumed
her work. “Here’s hopin’ Miss Frost’ll never
lose those magnifyin’ spectacles!”</p>

<p>“You never saw any one admire another
more sincerely. Why, she takes it for granted
that Mrs. Bruce made <i>me</i>, and is in love with
her work.”</p>

<p>Betsy dropped her hands.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘God moves in a mysterious way,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">His wonders to perform!’”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">she declared. “Rosalie,” she added gently,
“I wouldn’t wonder one mite if Lavinia Frost
livin’ with Mrs. Bruce would be the makin’ o’
<i>her</i>. What do we all want? We want love.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
Mrs. Bruce hasn’t drawn it to herself from
the folks that’s lived closest to her. She’s had
some sharp lessons, from what Mr. Irving says,
and now, when the plough’s gone deep, and
the soil’s softer, this cheerful little lover may
be takin’ her just at the right time, and will
make a big difference in her.”</p>

<p>“Why, I seem to see it begin,” returned
Rosalie. “She’s so much more gentle, and
Miss Frost chirps and twitters around her,
and waits on her—”</p>

<p>Betsy nodded. “That’s right,” she said
with satisfaction. “That’s good. She loves
bein’ made of. I b’lieve that’ll work well.”</p>

<p>There was another silence, which Betsy broke.</p>

<p>“I understand you’ve got somethin’ for
me,” she said.</p>

<p>The girl looked around, puzzled.</p>

<p>“Why,—why no, Betsy.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Irving says so.”</p>

<p>Rosalie regarded her calmly, but the faint
color deepened in her cheeks.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what he means.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know who else should.”
Betsy took a letter out of her pocket and
tossed it across to her guest, who opened it,
and read:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Betsy</span>,—I’m feeling very important
because they’ve wired for me from the
bank. I can’t even run over to the cottage
to see you, because I must make a train. I’ve
asked Rosalie to give you a hug for me. Good-by.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your devoted</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Boy</span>.<br />
</p></div>

<p>“Oh, you mean that,” said Rosalie quietly,
refolding the note.</p>

<p>“Of course I mean that. Do you suppose I
want to be cheated out o’ his hugs?”</p>

<p>The girl smiled and shook her head. “I
certainly haven’t any of them,” she said.</p>

<p>“But he found time to go over and say
good-by to you, I notice.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he came. Mrs. Bruce and Miss Frost
are to follow him in a day or two.”</p>

<p>“What do you think o’ the young man, now
you’ve summered him?” asked Betsy quietly.</p>

<p>“If I didn’t think well of him I’d never
dare to tell you so.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. Has he been specially attentive
to any one o’ the girls at the inn?”</p>

<p>Rosalie twisted the curtain tassel and looked
out at the sea.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered after some moments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
“If I hadn’t known—if you hadn’t told me
that—even if he <i>were</i>, the ending of the summer
would end his remembrance, I might have
been—well, pretty silly a good many times.”</p>

<p>Betsy looked up. “I hope I haven’t made
a mistake, or spoiled any o’ your good times,
dear.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the girl. “I’ve been more
than glad of all your warnings. Everybody
has been so kind, and there have been so many
people who wanted to do things for me, that
it was made easy in one way. I could avoid
him without it’s looking strange to him, or
any one else.”</p>

<p>“Was there,” asked Betsy, “was there any
other o’ the young men that you liked—just
as well?”</p>

<p>Rosalie turned and gave her a look. There
was the darkening of the eyes that Betsy
remembered, and the lip was caught under
the girl’s teeth.</p>

<p>Betsy fumbled with her darning-egg, dropped
her eyes, and cleared her throat.</p>

<p>“That child won’t <i>ever</i> learn to be mejum!”
she thought.</p>

<p>“You’ve worked and played pretty hard,
I guess,” she said, presently. “You’re some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
thin, Rosalie. I’ve been noticin’ it lately. I
hope you feel real good.”</p>

<p>“Never better,” was the reply. “I’m eager
to go to work—real work. I hope I can make
the girls like me.”</p>

<p>“Law, child, you’ll have to fight ’em off,”
was the reply. “Did—did you and Mr.
Irving part real friendly?”</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly. I must show you something
he gave me a good while ago.”</p>

<p>The girl rose and went to her own room.
Betsy laid down her work and gazed ahead.
“Ain’t she made o’ the real stuff, though!”
she thought. “I guess Irving Bruce has found
out that porcelain’s pretty strong sometimes!”</p>

<p>Here Rosalie returned and put into her
friend’s hands an exquisite white fan, whose
carved sticks Betsy examined with admiration.</p>

<p>“If he’s given you this?” she said, looking
up questioningly.</p>

<p>“He had to, I suppose,” returned the girl,
“practically; he broke mine the first night we
met at the inn. It was part of my outfit. I
couldn’t object to his making it good.”</p>

<p>Betsy laughed at the prosaic tone, and looked
back at the rich toy.</p>

<p>“He made it good, all right,” she remarked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
“When you need another outfit you can pawn
this.”</p>

<p>“It is very handsome,” said Rosalie, regarding
her possession, while the downcast
eyes darkened again under their drooping lids.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<small>THE NEW YEAR</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Autumn</span> with its crystalline days and frosty
nights gave Betsy glorious views from her
windows, but played havoc with her garden.</p>

<p>Hiram had long ago put up his boat, and
now he began building a small launch that
Irving Bruce had ordered for the following
season.</p>

<p>With Thanksgiving Day came Rosalie.
Hiram brought her home from the station in
high satisfaction, and it seemed as if Betsy
could never hear enough of her pleasant work
in the school.</p>

<p>“I’m bein’ awful mean and selfish,” announced
Betsy. “I haven’t asked one person
to dinner with us. Seems if we couldn’t share
our little girl with anybody else to-day.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hiram, “seems if some special
dispensation o’ common sense had been given
Betsy, for our benefit, Rosalie. I’ll have ye
know I keep an asylum. Never know any day
I come home to dinner who I’ll find here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
They get <i>their</i> Thanksgivin’ three hundred
and sixty-four days a year. I maintain we
deserve the sixty-fifth.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be such a goose, Hiram,” laughed
his wife. “This is all ’cause Mrs. Pogram
wanted to see you to-day, Rosalie. I told her
you were comin’ for the whole Christmas
vacation, and she should see you then.”</p>

<p>During dinner Rosalie told many things
about the school and her work, and afterward
the trio sat around an open fire while the first
snow of the season flung its stars upon the
window-panes.</p>

<p>“Do you hear from any o’ the Boston folks?”
asked Betsy.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have, once or twice. I must show
you some pictures I brought. They’re in my
suit-case.”</p>

<p>Rosalie ran upstairs to the cold little white
room.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Betsy,” said Hiram, as he
sat in a corner where the smoke from his pipe
curled up the chimney with that of the blazing
logs, “do you know I used to think last summer
Irvin’ Bruce was as set on Rosalie as I am
on you. I minded my own business, but I
wasn’t blind; and b’gosh I was surprised that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
he let her teach school this winter. D’ye s’pose
she could ’a’ given him the mitten?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t, Hiram. Pshaw! You know
how young men tag after a pretty girl who can
sing and dance and cut up and amuse ’em.
When it comes to marryin’, folks like the
Bruces want some one in their own set. Mr.
Irving—”</p>

<p>“Here they are,” said Rosalie, returning.
“Irving Bruce had some of our kodaks enlarged.
He said I might keep these, so I
brought them. I knew Captain Salter would
like to see himself as others see him.”</p>

<p>The Clever Betsy was indeed immortalized.
There were pictures of her exterior and interior;
and her captain held his pipe in his hand as
he looked upon the excellent likenesses of
himself and his passengers. Gay, smiling pictures
they were, except for his own dark
countenance; and in each photograph in which
Irving Bruce appeared, he was next to Rosalie.</p>

<p>The captain gave his wife a look of which
she was conscious, but which she refused to
receive.</p>

<p>“Set be hanged,” he muttered to himself.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Rosalie. “Aren’t they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
good? I’m going to leave one of them with
you and Betsy. Now, choose.”</p>

<p>“This one, then!” returned the captain.</p>

<p>In it Rosalie had one knee on the seat. Her
wavy hair was flying in a halo, and she was
laughing. Close behind her was Irving Bruce.
He was standing, his arm outstretched in some
gesture.</p>

<p>“That isn’t <i>my</i> choice,” said Betsy. “I’d
rather have this.”</p>

<p>She picked up a photograph of the Clever
Betsy under full sail. Gallantly she was breasting
a high sea.</p>

<p>“Why in the world!” objected Hiram; and
she caught his eyes with an expression he
seldom saw.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want the children?” he began.</p>

<p>She smiled a little. “I’ve no objection to
the children,” she answered, “but I want—the
boat.”</p>

<p>Hiram gazed at her with slow comprehension,
then he dropped the photographs and smoothed
his wife’s hair as she bent over her choice.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” he said radiantly. “That’s
<i>your</i> story, Rosalie,” handing a photograph
to her. “This is ours.”</p>

<p>The girl looked at the pair, wondering, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
wistful. She had not learned that the heart
is never old.</p>

<p>“Tell us more news from Boston,” said
Betsy when they were again settled around
the fire, Rosalie on a low stool pressed close
to her side.</p>

<p>“It is all pleasant. I had such an amusing
letter from Nixie. He says Helen is swimming
to the top of the social wave, that his mother
is busier than a hen with one chicken, and that
he himself sobs heavily in corners owing to
her neglect. He says the Bruce household is
serene, all but Miss Frost, who is too happy
to be serene. If she has one drive a week with
Mrs. Bruce in her electric, he says she talks
about her cousin’s generosity the next six
days. Nixie says Mrs. Bruce seems really
ashamed to complain of anything—”</p>

<p>“There,” interpolated Betsy gladly; “it’s
workin’.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Rosalie, “such a cheery little
woman is a sermon. It makes me think of some
verses I have seen:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘Just being happy is a fine thing to do;</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Looking at the bright side, rather than the blue;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sad or sunny musing, is largely in the choosing,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And just being happy is brave work and true.’”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s gospel, that is,” remarked Hiram.
“You learn that, Betsy, and say it to me every
time you plan to have Mrs. Pogram to dinner.”</p>

<p>Rosalie went back to her school-work with
good courage, refreshed by the visit to her
friends. Early in December she received a
formal but kind note from Mrs. Nixon asking
her to spend the Christmas holidays with her.</p>

<p>She smiled as she read it. Mr. Derwent was
behind the invitation, she knew, and Robert
reinforced it by one of his hare-brained but
hearty epistles, begging her to accept, and
promising her a luridly enthralling experience.</p>

<p>She was glad she could tell them that her
promise was given to Betsy for the holidays.
There would be a strange pleasure, she thought,
in seeing her summer playground in the embrace
of winter. The starry Thanksgiving
snow had vanished by morning; but now,
Betsy said, the great rock near the cottage
looked like a giant’s wedding-cake.</p>

<p>The weeks wore on, and the evergreen time
drew near. On Christmas morning Rosalie
wakened in her white room under the eaves
of the Salter house. It had been furnished
with an air-tight stove in honor of her visit,
and Betsy came in early to make a roaring fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>

<p>“Merry Christmas, Betsy!” cried the girl,
sitting up.</p>

<p>“It will be, child,” returned Betsy, “with
you for a treat.” She kissed her guest. “You
look like Aurora,” she added, in irrepressible
admiration of the girl’s soft coloring in the
white couch. “I know, ’cause I saw her picture
in Europe till I knew her as well as anybody
in the family album. To think you
might have waked up in the Nixon house this
mornin’! You could ’a’ run around in automobiles,
and danced, and had a real girl’s
good time; and here you are, mewed up with
two homespun folks like us, in a snow-bank,
with the ocean for a front yard, black enough
to bite you! I felt guilty when I waked up.
Honestly, I did.”</p>

<p>“Well, stop it, Betsy. This is the one place
in the world I want to be these holidays. Do
you believe me?”</p>

<p>Betsy shook her head. “It seems too good
to be true; but your eyes do look as if you
meant it. Here’s a big can o’ hot water, dear,
and when you come down, I’ll give you some
buckwheat cakes as good as you ever tasted.”</p>

<p>Betsy had maligned the landscape. Rosalie
looked out on spotless snow, but all the trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
visible along the village street were cased in
ice. Every twig sparkled as the sun gained
dominion over the sullen sea, and shone on
the dazzling, mammoth wedding-cake.</p>

<p>The week passed quickly and happily. Mrs.
Pogram gave a dinner for the Salters and their
guest, after Loomis and his <i>fiancée</i> had returned
to Portland. Captain Salter made
Rosalie recite to him the verses in praise of
happiness, all the time he was marching to
the function.</p>

<p>It was a season of content. Betsy could not
doubt it as she looked at the deepening roses
in the girl’s cheeks, and the way her eyes
sparkled as she came into the house, stamping
the snow from her boots, on the return from
some errand with Hiram.</p>

<p>Mr. Beebe, learning of her presence, took
the biggest sleigh from the inn stable and gave
them a long exhilarating ride into the country,
and an oyster supper when they returned.</p>

<p>On the last evening of the year Rosalie sat
before the open fire with Betsy. Captain
Salter had gone out on some errand in the
village, and Rosalie, on her favorite little stool,
leaned her head against Betsy’s knee and
watched the leaping flames. How remote, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
an evening like this, seemed the great world
from this little cottage-by-the-sea!</p>

<p>“One has so much time here, to think,
Betsy,” said the girl.</p>

<p>The other gave her one-sided smile. “Well,
yes,—holidays, we do,” she rejoined.</p>

<p>“You are always busy,” admitted Rosalie.
“How happy you and the captain are!”</p>

<p>“We think we couldn’t be happier,” returned
Betsy. “It’s been a wonderful year
for both you and me, Rosalie.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it has,” returned the girl dreamily.
“A year ago to-night—No! I must forget
all that.”</p>

<p>Betsy patted her shoulder. “Yesterday is
dead,” she said quietly.</p>

<p>Rosalie’s eyes lifted slowly to the other’s
face.</p>

<p>“Not all the yesterdays,” she said, and looked
back at the fire.</p>

<p>Betsy continued to pat her. The good
woman reflected concerning Irving Bruce with
an effort at self-control and fairness; but a
great longing that this girl should have her
heart’s desire passed over her like a wave.</p>

<p>A crunching of the snow sounded without.
If Rosalie had been intending to confide in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
her, the chance was lost. For the first time
Betsy regretted to hear her husband’s step.</p>

<p>“There’s Captain Salter,” said Rosalie.</p>

<p>The door opened. “Come in and get dry,”
said Betsy, without looking around. She felt
compunction for her momentary disloyalty.</p>

<p>“Thanks, I don’t care if I do.”</p>

<p>The women both started and turned. Irving
Bruce stood there, his broad shoulders sparkling
with snow. He set down his suit-case and
stamped his feet. “You’ll have to build a
porte-cochère, Betsy. The hack dumped me
at the back fence.”</p>

<p>The firelight fell on Rosalie as she stood,
flushing.</p>

<p>“Mr. Irving, <i>dear</i>!” cried Betsy, flying at
him, considerations of hostess and friend
stumbling over one another in the sudden
chaos of her mind. “What does this mean?”</p>

<p>“I just thought I’d run down and see the
New Year in with you. Where are your manners,
Rosalie? You might say you’re glad to
see me.”</p>

<p>Betsy saw his eyes and rejoiced.</p>

<p>“Of course I am,” returned the girl, “but
we country people aren’t used to shocks.”</p>

<p>He left his fur-lined overcoat in Betsy’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
arms, unconscious that he was burdening her;
and she clasped it to her breast as if it had been
part of himself. Her boy and her girl! Her boy
and her girl! And they were standing there,
their hands clasping, and their eyes meeting.</p>

<p>Irving had not taken the uninteresting
journey from Boston, and ploughed through
the Fairport snow to see the New Year in
with her. He had not broken away from the
holiday gayeties of which Betsy had experience,
to visit herself and Hiram in their snow-drift.
Betsy’s heart exulted, and her cheeks
were red.</p>

<p>“Sit up to the fire, Mr. Irving. I’m goin’ to
make you some coffee,” she said.</p>

<p>“I didn’t ask if you had any room for me,
but a blizzard seems to be starting. I can’t
go to the inn, now.”</p>

<p>“I guess I can put you somewhere. If you
don’t like the accommodations you can sit
up all night. There’s plenty o’ logs in the
wood-box.”</p>

<p>“I rather think I should like that. Have
to see the New Year in, anyway. No use making
two bites of a cherry.”</p>

<p>Just as the coffee was being poured, Captain
Salter came in. “My, but that smells good!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
he said; then, perceiving the new-comer—“Irvin’
Bruce, is that you?” he roared jovially.
“Well, you’re a good one. You’ll be
disappointed though. I haven’t got the boat
far enough along yet for you to tell anything
about it. I know you said you’d run up here,
but I calc’lated to let you know when.”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” returned Irving. “I hope you
don’t mind my coming, though.”</p>

<p>“Tickled to death, tickled to death,” responded
Hiram, receiving his coffee from his
wife’s hand and with it a look which made him
blink once or twice in doubt.</p>

<p>“See the New Year in? Yes indeed,” he
cried in answer to Irving’s explanation of his
presence. “That’s just what we’ll do. I
haven’t set up in years; but we’ll just sit
around this fire, and tell yarns—”</p>

<p>“Hiram Salter,” said his wife, “if you think
for one minute that we’re goin’ to do any such
thing, I <i>don’t</i>. I’ve got to get up and get the
breakfast, and you’ve got to get up and build
fires. As if we couldn’t trust the New Year
to come in respectably; and if you can’t, why,
Rosalie and Mr. Irving will attend to it.”</p>

<p>The captain looked at her, astonished.
Under cover of removing the cups and saucers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
to the kitchen, he spoke low to his consort.
“Go to bed?” he asked. “Where’s your
politeness, Betsy?”</p>

<p>“Where’s your common sense, Hiram Salter!
You think Irving Bruce has ploughed
down here to talk boats with <i>you</i>?”</p>

<p>Hiram scratched his head, and his eyes
widened. “Why, I said that very thing to you
the other night,” he protested, “and <i>you</i>
said—”</p>

<p>“Never mind what I said! Just get upstairs
as quick as you can.”</p>

<p>“Come with me, Mr. Irving,” said Betsy,
returning to the living-room. “Here’s a little
closet where you can’t much more’n turn
around, but I guess you’ll sleep well. It’s a
feather-bed.”</p>

<p>They stood alone in the chamber, and he
closed the door and took her by the shoulders
in the old familiar way.</p>

<p>“You remember our talk one night in the
garden?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, as if it was yesterday,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Do you apologize?”</p>

<p>“No,” she laughed.</p>

<p>“I think you poisoned the mind of the party
of the second part. Confess if you did. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
mean it; for if you didn’t, I’ve broken three engagements,
and traveled all day for nothing.”</p>

<p>“Yes—I—<i>did</i>!” returned Betsy boldly.</p>

<p>“Do you apologize?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it.”</p>

<p>They looked at each other in the dusk.
“Well, are you glad I came?”</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t, Mr. Irving,” replied Betsy
slowly, “I don’t know but I’d ’a’ given back
the silver!”</p>

<p>Irving pressed her hands and laughed.</p>

<p>In a little while the Salters said good-night
to their guests. “You can see, Irvin’, whether
I’m hen-pecked,” said the captain meekly,
as he mounted the stairs.</p>

<p>“You’re an awful warning,” replied Irving.</p>

<p>“Would it do any harm,” asked Hiram in a
stage-whisper when they reached their room,
“if I should yell down to ’em to look out the
window and see the weddin’-cake?”</p>

<p>Betsy locked the door.</p>

<p>Rosalie was sitting passive on her stool by
the fire. A rich color mantled in her cheeks,
but eyes and lips were grave. She was regaining
self-possession. Perhaps Irving had indeed
come on account of the boat.</p>

<p>He seated himself in the chair Betsy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
vacated, and watched the firelight play on
Rosalie’s hair.</p>

<p>“How do you suppose it looks in the canyon
to-night?” he asked, after a silence.</p>

<p>She shook her head. “I’m glad we can’t see.”</p>

<p>“And I,” he agreed. “I have it here.” He
touched his breast.</p>

<p>“Tell me about Nixie, and Helen,” said
Rosalie with sudden brightness.</p>

<p>“Time enough for that next year,” returned
Irving. He laid his watch on his knee; and for
a minute they both watched the tiny second-hand,
inexorably hurrying.</p>

<p>“How quiet it is!” he said. “What a place
for the year to die. I have a kindness for this
old year, Rosalie. I should dread to see it go
if I didn’t have such hopes for the new.”</p>

<p>“Yes, your business prospects are brilliant,
Mr. Derwent told me once.”</p>

<p>“Betsy Foster,” said Irving slowly, “‘Clever
Betsy,’ that deep, dark, deceitful, and designing
woman who is upstairs now, wide-awake,
wondering what I am saying to you,
talked to you once about me, and told you
to remember that men were deceivers ever.
She warned you against me. She’s given me
an up-hill pull all summer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>Rosalie’s heart fluttered wildly.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t sure until I had been back in
Boston for weeks that I loved you; but I suspected
it. I know that I have nothing more
than a fair chance, if I have that; but I’m sure
now, Rosalie, that you are the one woman in
the world for me. You’re the combination of
everything I ever admired in any girl. If there
is no one that has a better right, give me the
chance to win you. I’ve come here to ask you
that.”</p>

<p>She sat so immovable that Irving stooped
forward. The face she lifted had the darkening
eyes, the trembling lips, that Betsy had seen.</p>

<p>“When you caught me from the cliff,” she
said, “I felt your heart beat. The sunrise in
the canyon was the sunrise of my life. Every
pulse of my heart since that morning has
beaten with the pulse of yours.”</p>

<p>He looked at her, wonder, incredulity, joy,
holding him motionless for a space; then in
the still, snow-bound cottage, golden with firelight,
Rosalie’s lover took her in his arms.
“My dove!” he murmured.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access

other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
